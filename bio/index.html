              <p>My name is Gabriel Esquivel, everyone calls me &ldquo;Gabo&rdquo;. I was born in Costa Rica in 1984 and was raised by loving family that thought me well to respect others and always focus on the solution to problems.</p>

<p>Since I was a little child I&rsquo;ve loved sports, specially Soccer, but also Capoeira (brazilian martial), Yoga and Surfing; I dreamed with traveling the world, meet different cultures and learning new languages; so I dedicated some time prior to Bachelors to study foreign languages and today I can communicate fluently in English, Portuguese, Italian and Spanish.</p>

<p>In 2007 I started my Software Engineering studies at CenfoTec University in San José where I discovered my passion software and product development and the potential of the Web Platform.</p>

<p>Around 2009 I got first job as Web Developer builting wordpress sites and around a year later I was hired as UI Engineer for americanexpress.com through an outsourcing company based in Costa Rica.</p>

<p>In 2010 I started Costa Rica JS, a meetup group in San José for people interested applications development with JavaScript. At the time Node.js was starting the get traction and SPA frameworks where blooming. Today the Costa Rican JS community is the largest meetup in Central America with more than 1600 members.</p>

<p>In 2011 I started to work independently as a freelance developer and during the course of the years I have had the opportunity to work in many different projects in multicultural, multi-timezone remote agile teams. I worked with several clients, mainly digital agencies, startups and development shops.</p>

<p>Through hard work and a lot of study I grew from web developer with skills for client side apps to a fullstack engineer that can work end to end, from mobile apps to cloud, databases and devops automation. I&rsquo;ve played the role of lead architect and agile manager in my recent engagements, mentoring and leading the development team from the perspective of someone that has been there in the trenches; keeping a positive and friendly attitude, trying to make engineers as happy an productive as they can possibly be and also leveraging technologies that provide competitive business advantages such as less time-to-market and better user experiences.</p>

<p>In 2016 I married @laubits, my beloved wife who gave me a beautiful daughter named Coral, my motivation and my happiness.</p>

<p>This year, 2017, I started a new DevOps meetup group in San Jose focused on cloud computing, virtualization, systems reliability engineering and process automation with 400 members as of today. I also joined a FinTech startup ( a neobank ) as CTO and led the formation of a world class team and the development of an alpha version of the app with the most modern and cost effective technology stack en latam in financial services; very unfortunately the relationship with the CEO wasn&rsquo;t good at the end so I couldn&rsquo;t continue working with them, but I did leave a great engineer and friend of mine taking care of business and I wish them great success.</p>

<p>I recently founded a consulting and staff augmentation company called Cortical Touch through which I continue offering my professional services as on-demand CTO/VPE/Consultant for startups and enterprise clients. The team augmentation service is also very good, our pool is curated very carefully. Learn more at <a target="_blank" href="https://corticaltouch.com">corticaltouch.com</a></p>
