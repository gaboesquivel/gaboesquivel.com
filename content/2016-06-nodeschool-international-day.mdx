On May 21st, the Nodeschool International Day was celebrated for the third consecutive year in Costa Rica. The event aims to promote the learning of JavaScript and Node.js through in-person workshops using interactive modules that help you learn or improve by writing code and solving problems with the help of volunteer mentors.

This year, the event was held at the Jean Piaget Auditorium of the Omar Dengo Foundation, and we had the support of excellent sponsors.

The event was scheduled to start at 10:00 am; however, from 8:30 am, we had a large number of people waiting for us to open the auditorium doors, which motivated us greatly.

We had an excellent attendance of 150 participants and 30 collaborators who served as mentors, for a total of 180 people. The atmosphere was friendly, very lively, and a sense of community prevailed at all times.

In the afternoon, once the workshops were over, there was also a very pleasant space where our sponsors held quite interesting raffles, from books to gaming monitors, where the luckiest ones were awarded prizes.

At Costa Rica JS, we are very happy and satisfied with the positive feedback many have given through meetup, social networks, and articles like the one from revistaentoas.com, which emphasizes the need for more events like this in Costa Rica.
