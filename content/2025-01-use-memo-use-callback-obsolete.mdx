For years, `useMemo` and `useCallback` have been the go-to tools for [React developers](/frontend) looking to optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary computations and function re-creations. However, with the latest advancements in [React](/tech/react), their necessity has significantly diminished. In this post, I'll break down why they are now mostly redundant and when you might still need them.

## The Original Use Case: Preventing Unnecessary Renders

React's reconciliation algorithm is quite efficient, but unnecessary re-renders can still impact performance, especially in complex applications. The idea behind `useMemo` and `useCallback` was simple:

- **`useMemo`**: Caches the result of a computation, preventing recalculations unless dependencies change.
- **`useCallback`**: Caches a function reference to prevent child components from unnecessarily re-rendering when passed as props.

This made sense in the era when React re-renders were more aggressive and when components frequently relied on referential equality to determine updates.


## Why They're No Longer Necessary in Most Cases

### 1. **Modern React Optimizations Make Them Redundant**
With **React 18's Concurrent Mode**, **automatic batching**, and improvements in **React Compiler** optimizations (like RSC and React Forget), React has become significantly smarter about avoiding unnecessary re-renders. Components now update more efficiently, reducing the need for manual memoization.

- **Automatic Memoization in React Compiler**: The React team is working on a compiler that will optimize component re-renders automatically, removing the need for `useMemo` and `useCallback` in most cases.
- **Rendering Scheduling and Priority Management**: React now schedules renders more intelligently, making unnecessary recomputations a smaller issue than before.

### 2. **Garbage Collection & Memory Pressure Issues**
One of the problems with `useMemo` and `useCallback` is that they hold onto references longer than necessary, leading to unnecessary memory retention. In some cases, their overuse can actually **harm** performance rather than help. This is a common issue in software engineering.

### 3. **Inline Functions Are Cheap in Modern JavaScript Engines**
Many developers use `useCallback` out of habit, believing it prevents unnecessary re-renders. But in most cases, **inline functions are already optimized** by modern JavaScript engines, making `useCallback` redundant.

- **Modern V8 optimizations** ensure that functions declared inline inside a component are efficiently garbage-collected and reallocated.
- **Referential equality checks** are not always meaningful in React reconciliation, as components don't always rely on the same function reference.

### 4. **React.memo Is Usually a Better Approach**
Instead of manually memoizing functions with `useCallback`, simply wrapping a component with `React.memo` is often the more effective and concise solution.

```tsx
const ExpensiveComponent = React.memo(({ value }) => {
  console.log("Rendering...");
  return <div>{value}</div>;
});

export default function Parent({ count }) {
  return <ExpensiveComponent value={count} />;
}
```

`React.memo` ensures that `ExpensiveComponent` only re-renders when `value` actually changes—without needing `useCallback`.


## When Should You Still Use `useMemo` or `useCallback`?
While largely unnecessary, `useMemo` and `useCallback` still have valid use cases in complex applications:

1. **Computationally Expensive Operations**
   - If a component performs expensive calculations, memoizing the result with `useMemo` prevents unnecessary recomputation.
   
   ```tsx
   const result = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(data), [data]);
   ```

2. **Memoizing Dependencies in Custom Hooks**
   - If a custom hook depends on function identity, `useCallback` ensures the function reference doesn't change between renders.
   
   ```tsx
   const fetchData = useCallback(() => fetch(apiUrl), [apiUrl]);
   useEffect(() => { fetchData(); }, [fetchData]);
   ```

3. **Preventing Unnecessary Renders in Context Providers**
   - When passing functions down through React Context, `useCallback` can help prevent unnecessary re-renders of consumers.

4. **Avoiding Unnecessary Object Creation in Dependency Arrays**
   - When passing objects as dependencies in hooks like `useEffect`, `useMemo` ensures stable object references.
   
   ```tsx
   const memoizedOptions = useMemo(() => ({ limit: 10 }), []);
   ```

5. **When You Notice a UX Problem**
   - The best rule of thumb is to **start without `useMemo` and `useCallback`**. Only add them when you experience **noticeable performance issues** to the human eye, such as **lagging, stuttering animations, or delays** in rendering complex components.
   - Instead of preemptively optimizing, **profile your application** and add these hooks when a real bottleneck is identified.


## Conclusion: Less Is More

The takeaway? In **modern [React](/tech/react) apps, you should default to not using `useMemo` and `useCallback` unless you truly need them.** Overusing them leads to **unnecessary complexity**, potential memory overhead, and ironically, worse performance.

Instead, trust React's rendering optimizations and use these hooks only when profiling reveals a bottleneck. The era of manually memoizing everything is fading—React itself is becoming smart enough to handle performance for us. This shift in approach is valuable knowledge for [technical leadership](/lead) in React projects.
