As [AI systems](/ai) grow more capable, Model Context Protocol (MCP)—proposed by Anthropic in 2024—has emerged as a foundational standard for connecting models to external data, tools, and services. MCP defines how AI models interface with external tools and data, offering a consistent, modular structure for building real-world intelligent systems.

In this post, we'll unpack what MCP means in practice and how to implement it using [TypeScript](/tech/typescript) and modern AI tooling.

## What Is MCP?

MCP is a specification that standardizes how AI models interact with external APIs, databases, and tools. By clearly defining context, tools, and workflows, MCP simplifies the development of [agentic systems](/ai) that go beyond simple prompting.

It allows developers to:

* Declare available tools and capabilities
* Share memory and execution logs across calls
* Maintain clean separation between model logic and business logic

## Why MCP Matters Now

The AI ecosystem has evolved rapidly:

* We're building multi-step reasoning systems, not one-shot prompts.
* LLMs now support function calling, streaming, and memory integration.
* Tooling like LangChain.js, Mastra, and Vercel AI SDK enables MCP architecture with TypeScript.

MCP offers a standardized interface to manage this complexity and improve reusability, observability, and control.

## Implementing MCP in TypeScript

TypeScript's static typing, modular architecture, and growing ecosystem of AI libraries make it an ideal language for building [AI systems](/ai) that follow the MCP specification.

We'll walk through how each pillar of MCP is implemented using TS-native frameworks.

### Modular: Isolated Units of Capability

```tsx
// tools/search.ts
export const search = async (query: string) => {
  const res = await fetch(`/api/search?q=${query}`);
  return res.json();
};

// memory/vector.ts
export const storeEmbedding = async (embedding: number[]) => {
  await db.insert({ embedding });
};
```

### Composable: Wiring Modules Dynamically

```tsx
import { Agent } from 'mastra';
import { search } from './tools/search';
import { storeEmbedding } from './memory/vector';

const agent = new Agent({ tools: [search], memory: { store: storeEmbedding } });
await agent.run("Find latest AI news and store key terms");
```

### Persistent: Retaining State Across Sessions

```tsx
const memory = new VectorMemory({ db: pgvector });

await memory.save({ userId: '123', embedding: await getEmbedding("AI regulation") });
const context = await memory.query({ userId: '123' });
```

This persistence allows agents to evolve contextually, supporting long-term planning and behavior in AI applications.

## Use Cases

* Agents that remember user preferences
* Workflow automation with persistent state
* Multi-agent systems coordinating via shared memory
* AI-powered dashboards with modular, updatable logic

## Key Challenges

| Challenge     | Considerations                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Interop       | Standardizing interfaces between modules         |
| State storage | Choosing the right DB for persistence            |
| Composability | Ensuring modules can be reused cleanly           |
| Type safety   | Using [TS](/tech/typescript) to enforce contracts between components |

## Final Thoughts

MCP marks a turning point in how we interface AI models with the world. It abstracts complexity, enforces modularity, and promotes interoperability—qualities that make [AI systems](/ai) easier to maintain, scale, and trust. For developers working with [TypeScript](/tech/typescript) and modern AI stacks, MCP isn't just a spec—it's a foundation for building future-ready intelligence.
