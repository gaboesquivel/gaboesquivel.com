On Saturday, February 2nd, 2019, the first international crypto and blockchain conference in Costa Rica was held at Club Unión in San José. Founded in 1925, this historic club was once the preferred meeting place of the upper political and business classes during the liberal period. Today, it is becoming an important center for activities related to cryptocurrencies and blockchain innovation in Costa Rica.

The event was co-organized by several blockchain organizations and groups based in Costa Rica: [BlockchainCR](https://blockchaincr.com), [AsoBlockchain](https://asoblockchain.org), [EOS Costa Rica](https://eoscostarica.io), [Comunidad Bitcoin](https://www.meetup.com/Comunidad-Bitcoin/), and [Nimiq](https://nimiq.com). It received support and sponsorship from both local and international companies.

This event marked a significant milestone for the Costa Rican blockchain community, reflecting our efforts to educate and promote the adoption of blockchain technology in the country. The high attendance and engaging atmosphere made it an excellent networking opportunity.

I had the privilege of speaking about open source, blockchain, and EOS Costa Rica's projects. The audience was very receptive and eager to learn more about how open source leads to better software and how blockchain empowers people in unprecedented ways.

I also conducted a workshop on EOSIO and smart contract development for a group of senior engineers working in financial services, gambling, and automation.
