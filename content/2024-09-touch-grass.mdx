As a self-confessed workaholic, I've burned out more times than I care to admit. You know the feeling—your productivity is on fire, only for that fire to burn you out instead of fueling you. After running into that wall enough times, I've learned something crucial: no matter how important the [project](/fullstack) is, your mental and physical health come first. In the startup grind, especially in [tech](/tech) circles, this can feel like sacrilege—but trust me, it's true.

And the key to staying sane? You've got to leave the monitor behind and touch grass. Literally.

### Move Your Body, Move Your Mind

We spend hours [coding](/frontend), designing, or strategizing in front of a screen, and our bodies weren't built for that kind of stillness. Stiff shoulders, foggy brain, and back pain—classic signs you've hit the point of diminishing returns.

It's easy to ignore these warning signals when you're deep in a project, telling yourself, *"Just one more line of code,"* or, *"I'll fix this bug and then rest."* But that constant sitting messes with your circulation, and more importantly, your clarity.

That's where **Grass Hour** comes in—your dedicated time to step away, clear your mind, and reconnect with the real world.

### Why You Need a Grass Hour

My breakthrough came when I found my **Grass Hour**. For me, it's in the morning—an early two-hour hike. No screens, just fresh air and movement. It's when I get my legs working, time my hike to catch the sunrise, and feel connected to something beyond the grind. For me, it's a spiritual reset too—a chance to reconnect with God. But even if you're not religious, the introspection and mindfulness that come from simply being outdoors can work wonders for your mental state.

### Health, Productivity, and a Clearer Mind

Building **Touch Grass** moments into my daily routine has changed the game for me. Physically, I feel stronger. Mentally, I feel more balanced. And most importantly, I've stopped burning out. Instead of hitting that midday slump or feeling overwhelmed, I come back to my work more focused, sharper, and ready to dive in.

The irony? The less time I spend glued to my desk, the more productive I've become. Quality over quantity.

### Finding Your Grass Hour

Everyone's Grass Hour looks different. Maybe yours is in the morning like mine, or maybe it's a late-night stroll or an afternoon break. The key is finding that time to step away from your screen, recharge, and touch grass—literally or figuratively.

If you're caught in the workaholic grind, you need this more than you realize. Start small. Walk around the block, hit the park, or even stand barefoot on the grass for a minute. Or, if you need to really unwind, take a more *relaxed* approach—whatever helps you reset.

This isn't about cutting back on your ambition or drive. It's about sustainability. We need to be in this for the long haul, and if you don't take care of yourself, you won't be there for your big breakthrough. This applies especially to those in [leadership](/lead) positions.

So, find your Grass Hour. Commit to it. Your mind and body will thank you. And trust me, you'll see the benefits spill over into every other aspect of your life.
