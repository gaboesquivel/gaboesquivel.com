BlockchainCR is excited to introduce "Costa Rica's [Crypto](/web3) Cantina," a recurring after-office happy hour event that will take place every Thursday, starting on September 27th, 2018, at 6 pm at the Central Pub in Paseo Col√≥n.

The purpose of this event is to bring together individuals who share an enthusiasm for blockchain, cryptography, and cryptocurrency in Costa Rica. It is an opportunity to connect people from various backgrounds and foster a forward-thinking community centered around blockchain and distributed consensus technologies.

This event is open to everyone, and there is no need for reservations or advance notice of your attendance. There will not be any presentations or formal talks; it is all about the people.

So, skip the Thursday traffic jams and drop by to say hello!
