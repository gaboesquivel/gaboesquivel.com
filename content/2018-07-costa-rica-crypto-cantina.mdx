BlockchainCR is thrilled to introduce "Costa Rica's Crypto Cantina," a recurring after-office happy hour event set to take place every Thursday, commencing on September 27th, 2018, at 6 pm at the Central Pub in Paseo Colón.

The purpose of this event is to unite individuals who share an enthusiasm for blockchain, cryptography, and cryptocurrency in Costa Rica. It's an opportunity to connect people from various backgrounds and nurture a forward-thinking community centered around blockchain and distributed consensus technologies.

This event is open to everyone, and there's no need for reservations or advance notice of your attendance. There won't be any presentations or formal talks; it's all about the people.

So, skip the Thursday traffic jams and drop by to say hello!
