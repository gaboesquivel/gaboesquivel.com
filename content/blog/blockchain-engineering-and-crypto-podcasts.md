The past year I've dedicated my time to the study and development of blockchain based solutions. It's a new paradigm and everything changes very quickly, just like the open source world, a bit more hectic I'd say. There's a lot going on and it's hard to keep pace. One of the resources that really help me keep track of new techniques and technologies are the podcasts, I hear them while I drive, wait on lines, jogging, even when taking a shower. I think it's a great way to utilize that "idle" time more productively.  This is a small curated list of my favorite blockchain podcasts.

### Software Engineering Radio

This is one of the best engineering podcasts I know of and their blockchain chapter has a lot great content for engineers.

Software Engineering Radio is a podcast targeted at the professional software developer. The goal is to be a lasting educational resource, not a newscast. Three to four times per month, they publish a new episode talking to experts from the software engineering world about the full range of topics that matter to professional developers.
