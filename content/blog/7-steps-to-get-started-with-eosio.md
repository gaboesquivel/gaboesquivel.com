I’ve worked on software development for 10 years now, mainly on JavaScript applications: nodejs and single page apps. On 2017, I decided to focus the rest of professional career on blockchain technology, smart contracts and decentralized applications; I co-founded [BlockchainCR](https://blockchaincr.com), a community hub for knowledge sharing, promoting and studying blockchain technologies in Costa Rica, and in 2018 I joined [EOS Costa Rica](httpd://eoscostarica.io), an EOSIO block producer and software development company.

I currently work configuring EOSIO nodes for public and private blockchains and writing smart contracts. The path to learn wasn’t that easy, to be honest. Specially because I hadn’t touched c++ since my university days.

Here’s a short list of seven steps that might serve you as guide if you are starting to develop smart contracts for EOSIO blockchains:

- Learn the basics: blockchain and its use cases. https://learn.eoscostarica.io/

- Learn EOSIO history, purpose and its consensus algorithm (dpos)

- Learn about the different EOSIO components: nodeos, cleos, keosd, cdt.

- Learn cpp: the general concepts and syntax.

- Learn the smart contract api.

- Read other people’s smart contracts.

- Write your own contracts, that’s only way actually learn anything! 
It’s good follow a design have process.

- Be patient, you are going need time to start flowing.

Additionally, join the developer telegram groups and stack exchange:

- EOSIO Stack Exchange https://eosio.stackexchange.com/
