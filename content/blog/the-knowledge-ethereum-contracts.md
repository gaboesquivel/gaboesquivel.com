The past months I’ve been working hard with the Knolwedge.io engineering team developing the infrastructure, services and Ethereum smart contracts for the Knowledge launch and ICO starting on January 15th, 2018.
Knowledge.io is producing an ecosystem that offers significant improvement in the areas of ad tech, commerce, education, and employment, and a supply and demand marketplace of goods and services, all based around rewarding users for what the massive and centralized supergiants utilize to make extraordinary profits — people’s data. The Knowledge.io ecosystem is built on the foundation of decentralization and rewarding people for sharing their knowledge.

Our technology stack is composed by the most modern, secure and flexible software development frameworks including AWS Serverless, ReactNative, React.js, Infra-as-Code with Cloud Formation and Zero-Trust network configurations. All this with Continuous Integration and Delivery pipelines, following industry standards and security best practices.
I have had the opportunity and resources to hire the best developers and it has been an amazing experience working with such talented team. I want to thank particularly [Diego Barahona](https://github.com/diestrin) for the all the research and exquisite work put into the Ethereum smart contracts. I’m very proud of what we accomplished in so short amount of time.

A couple of weeks ago we open sourced our code on [github.com/knowledge](https://github.com/knowledge).
The Ethereum smart contracts codebase was published at [github.com/knowledge/knowledge-contracts](https://github.com/knowledge/knowledge-contracts). If you are a software developer interested in Ethereum development take a minute of your time take a look, I know you will find it useful.
