Last Saturday, April 11, several members of the Costa Rica JS group gathered, this time we broke the mold a bit and went to Under Fire Paintball territory.

Once we arrived, we had to adapt to a rather cool climate, but it was not an obstacle to enjoy. We divided into two groups and once we put on the necessary protective equipment and received instructions from the referees, we headed to the playing fields, where the team with a majority of women stood out quite a bit as they won most of the games, something that surprised us all. Talking to the girls, we realized that the key was teamwork and strategy.

We thank the la404 group that accompanied us and sponsored the bullets for one of the teams.
