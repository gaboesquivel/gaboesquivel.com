_**Note:** Since inception, we have evolved the scope of BasilicEVM to be a more flexible and broader [EVM](/tech/evm) development starter.
While 0x API and Codex.io integrations are still highly recommended for production applications, they are no longer included 
by default in the starter template. For the latest features and integrations, please visit the [BasilicEVM GitHub repository](https://github.com/blockmatic/basilic-evm)._

In the rapidly evolving landscape of [blockchain development](/web3), the tools you choose can make or break your project. That's why I'm excited to introduce BasilicEVM. A comprehensive development stack designed to streamline the creation of EVM based applications. Whether you're building DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, or any decentralized application, BasilicEVM equips you with the best tools and practices to get the job done efficiently and effectively.

## A Closer Look at BasilicEVM

### Revolutionizing User Experience with Gasless Swaps

One of the standout features of BasilicEVM is its support for gasless swaps, powered by the 0x API v2 and the Tx Relay API. This integration eliminates the friction and complexities associated with gas fees, which are often a significant barrier for users in decentralized exchanges (DEXs). By removing gas-related hurdles, BasilicEVM:

- Reduces failed trades by up to 85% compared to traditional DEXes.
- Confirms transactions on-chain an average of one block earlier, enhancing the trading experience.
- Protects trades from Miner Extractable Value (MEV) attacks, safeguarding users' assets.
- Simplifies the trading process, reducing drop-offs due to insufficient gas.
  
For developers, this means fewer user complaints about failed transactions and a more streamlined trading experience, which can directly translate to higher user retention and satisfaction. The implementation is similar to Matcha Auto's, ensuring that your dApp benefits from battle-tested technology.

### Comprehensive Blockchain Data Insights

BasilicEVM integrates Codex.io, a powerful tool for managing and analyzing blockchain data, used by industry leaders like TradingView, Matcha.xyz, and Sudoswap. Codex provides:

- Real-time access to pricing, volume, liquidity, and wallet data across 60+ networks, including [Ethereum](/tech/ethereum), Solana, and Arbitrum.
- Coverage of over 6 million tokens and 1 billion NFTs, giving you access to a vast dataset without the need for custom indexers.
- Instant insights with real-time and historical charts, helping you make informed decisions based on the latest market trends.

This integration simplifies the development of data-rich applications by eliminating the overhead of infrastructure management. You can build applications that provide deep insights into market behaviors and user activities, enabling your users to make smarter decisions. For developers, this means more time focused on innovation and less time wrestling with data pipelines.

### Modern Architecture for High-Performance Applications

BasilicEVM is built on a modern stack that ensures your applications are not only scalable but also performant and secure. Here's what's under the hood:

- **Turbo Monorepo and Bun**: Efficient management of large-scale codebases and ultra-fast build processes.
- **Biome and [Next.js](/tech/next-js) 14**: Modern tooling for web projects, ensuring quick iterations, robust server-side rendering, and improved SEO.
- **Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui**: Flexible, utility-first CSS and accessible components for rapid UI development.
- **EVM Integration**: Seamless blockchain functionality through viem and wagmi, providing type-safe interactions and React hooks.
- **RainbowKit**: Out-of-the-box wallet connection library, offering a polished and customizable [UI](/frontend) for connecting to various wallets.

This stack is designed for speed and scalability, supporting everything from rapid prototyping to high-concurrency operations. With clear conventions and [AI](/ai)-assisted development tools like cursor.so and v0.dev, BasilicEVM ensures that your team can maintain high code quality while moving fast. This approach supports modern full-stack development practices.

### Building the Future Together

BasilicEVM is on its early stages with a minimal set of features. I invite you to explore the [BasilicEVM GitHub repository](https://github.com/blockmatic/basilica-evm) and contribute to its growth. Whether you're adding new features, improving documentation, or simply experimenting, your contributions are invaluable. This is a great project for developers looking to improve their technical skills.
