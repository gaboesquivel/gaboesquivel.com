WebSockets are essential for [real-time applications](/backend)—from trading engines to AI assistants. But when you move from prototype to production, things get tricky. Especially when uptime, load balancing, and secure communication matter.

Here's how I approach scaling WebSocket backends in high-availability environments without compromising security or [developer experience](/fullstack).

## Persistent Connections Meet Distributed Systems

WebSockets maintain a long-lived TCP connection, which breaks traditional stateless load balancing. That’s where session affinity (sticky sessions) come in.

**NGINX**, **HAProxy**, and most managed load balancers like [AWS](/tech/aws) ALB support sticky sessions based on cookies or IP hashing. This ensures clients consistently route to the same backend node, keeping their connection alive.


## Secure It: wss\:// or Bust

You should *never* run production WebSockets over `ws://`. Always use `wss://` (TLS-encrypted).

You can terminate TLS at the load balancer (e.g., Cloudflare or NGINX) and forward traffic to internal nodes over plain TCP. Just make sure to:

* Use valid certificates (Let's Encrypt or managed)
* Redirect all insecure connections
* Set proper CORS policies if the [frontend](/frontend) is hosted separately


## Auth Is Not Optional

WebSocket connections don’t support traditional HTTP headers after the handshake. So you need to authenticate early and smartly.

I usually go with:

* JWT-based auth on connection
* Validated via query string or an initial message payload
* Optionally, revalidate tokens periodically in long sessions

Pair that with **[Redis](/tech/redis)** or **Kafka** for coordinating presence, rate-limiting, or propagating bans across nodes.


## Redis Pub/Sub: The Backbone of Multi-Node Messaging

In multi-instance setups, your WebSocket servers need to communicate. If one user connects to Node A, and their friend connects to Node B, how do they chat?

Simple: publish to a central broker. I usually default to **Redis Pub/Sub** for simplicity and speed. If you need durability or streaming, go Kafka.


## Bun WebSocket: A New Performance Baseline

If you're building with [Bun](https://bun.sh/), you get access to its fast native WebSocket implementation.

Bun WebSocket is extremely lightweight and handles thousands of concurrent connections with low memory overhead. You can:

* Launch a standalone server using Bun's `serve()` with native `upgrade` handling
* Integrate with Redis Pub/Sub or a shared memory queue
* Use Bun's edge-focused performance to run it close to users

It’s a solid choice for edge-native, low-latency real-time apps.


## Rate-Limiting, Monitoring, and DDoS Protection

Never expose a WebSocket server directly to the open internet without protection. Use:

* **Cloudflare** or a WAF in front
* Basic IP-based rate limiting at the load balancer
* Application-level limits for messages per second/user
* Logging and metrics via Prometheus, Datadog, or Sentry

## TL;DR Checklist

* Sticky sessions via load balancer (cookie or IP hash)
* TLS with `wss://` only
* Token-based auth handshake
* Redis for pub/sub or shared state
* Bun WebSocket for low-latency edge-native performance
* Rate limiting + monitoring
* Health checks and auto-scaling

Whether it's [Web3](/web3) trading apps, multiplayer UIs, or streaming [AI](/ai) results. WebSockets are powerful, but they demand a clear architecture to scale securely.
