Returning to Costa Rica and enjoying my homeland while working on software applications has been one of the best decisions of my life. Take a look at these photos I captured with my phone at Playa Manzanillo, near Santa Teresa - Mal Pa√≠s. This natural paradise, renowned for its world-class surfing, is among the most beautiful beaches in Costa Rica. You'll agree it's an ideal place to live or invest in the country.

Santa Teresa was recently awarded by Trip Advisor as the #1 highest-rated travel location in all of both Central and South America. Malpais and Montezuma both have many of the best restaurants in the entire country, as many international chefs have moved to the area. The area is also a major center of Costa Rica Yoga, with over a dozen places to learn/practice and many yoga retreats and surf+yoga retreat combinations.
