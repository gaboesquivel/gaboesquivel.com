## Architectural Principles

1. URL-based state management
2. Efficient data handling with API reads and EVM transaction writes
3. Efficient reactive blockchain interactions using Viem and Wagmi
4. Optimized data fetching using React Query
5. Feature-based code organization
6. Pragmatic abstraction (AHA Programming)

Let's dive deeper into each of these principles.


### Code Collocation

Code collocation is a principle in React development that emphasizes organizing code by feature or functionality rather than by file type. This approach, championed by Kent C. Dodds and others in the React community, offers several benefits:

- **Improved Maintainability**: By keeping related code close together, it's easier to understand and modify features.
- **Better Scalability**: As your application grows, collocated code remains manageable and doesn't spread across multiple directories.
- **Faster Development**: Developers can focus on one feature at a time without jumping between different files and folders.
- **Easier Refactoring**: When code is collocated, it's simpler to extract or move features as needed.

In practice, code collocation in React might look like this:

- Instead of separate directories for components, styles, and tests, you might have a feature-based structure.
- Related components, hooks, utilities, and tests are kept in the same directory.

For a more detailed explanation and examples, refer to Kent C. Dodds' article on the subject: [Colocation](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/colocation).

### Managing State with URLs

Relying on URLs for state changes in Next.js enhances user experience by preserving application state across page reloads and enabling easy sharing. This approach is particularly useful for managing user settings, filters, and other dynamic data.

Benefits of URL-Based State Management:

- **Persistence**: State information encoded in the URL survives page refreshes, crucial for applications where users may navigate away and return later.
- **Shareability**: Users can share specific application states via URLs, allowing direct access to particular views or settings.
- **SEO Advantages**: Canonical URLs help search engines understand which version of a page should be indexed, preventing duplicate content issues.


### One Subscription per Route

Implementing a single subscription for each route in a GraphQL or REST API architecture offers several advantages, particularly in terms of reducing connection overhead and simplifying data management. This approach involves consolidating multiple data streams into a single, comprehensive subscription tailored to each specific route. While GraphQL subscriptions maintain an open connection for real-time updates, this principle can also be applied to polling-based implementations in REST APIs, ensuring efficient and organized data fetching across the application.

Key Benefits:

- **Reduced Connection Overhead**: By consolidating multiple subscriptions into a single one per route, the number of active connections to the server decreases. Each connection incurs overhead in terms of resources and management, so fewer connections can lead to improved performance and lower latency.
- **Simplified Management**: Managing multiple subscriptions can be complex, especially in applications with numerous data streams. A single subscription per route simplifies this by reducing the number of subscriptions that need to be monitored and maintained, making it easier to implement changes or troubleshoot issues.
- **Streamlined Traffic Management**: With fewer connections, traffic management becomes more efficient. The server can handle requests and responses more effectively, optimizing resource allocation and potentially lowering costs associated with data transfer.

Cached Queries

Singleton instances of queries are a powerful optimization technique that reduces server connections and improves data consistency across components. This approach is particularly beneficial when multiple components require the same data, allowing them to share a single query instance.

Benefits of Cached Queries:

- **Reduced Server Load**: By minimizing redundant API calls, singleton queries decrease the overall load on your server.
- **Improved Performance**: Fewer network requests lead to faster page loads and a smoother user experience.
- **Consistent Data**: All components access the same data instance, ensuring consistency throughout the application.
- **Efficient Caching**: Centralized data management simplifies cache invalidation and updates.

Implementation with React Query:

React Query provides built-in support for singleton queries through its intelligent caching mechanism. The query key acts as a unique identifier:

Key aspects of React Query's caching behavior:

- **Caching**: Identical query keys return cached data, avoiding unnecessary API calls.
- **Smart Refetching**: React Query automatically refetches stale data or when specific conditions are met (e.g., window focus, network reconnection).
- **Shared State**: Components using the same query key share data and loading states.
- **Automatic Deduplication**: Simultaneous requests for the same data are consolidated into a single API call.

Best Practices:

- **Consistent Query Keys**: Use a standardized format for query keys to ensure proper caching and deduplication.
- **Granular Keys**: Include relevant parameters in the query key for precise cache management.
- **Global Queries**: For app-wide data, consider initializing queries at the root level.
- **Prefetching**: Utilize React Query's prefetching capabilities to load data before it's needed.

By leveraging cached queries effectively, you can significantly optimize your application's data fetching strategy, leading to improved performance and a better user experience.

React Query shines here because it provides robust caching and smart refetching. For Web3 apps, libraries like wagmi, which is based on TanStack's React Query, take this further by integrating blockchain interactions seamlessly into the same query-driven model. This means that querying an Ethereum node, for example, works similarly to querying an indexer or traditional Web2 API.

Wagmi's integration with React Query enables you to treat blockchain data (e.g., reading a contract state) the same way you'd handle an API call. By reusing familiar caching patterns, Web2 and Web3 merge into a unified data flow that feels natural to developers.

### Pragmatic Abstraction (AHA Programming)

Pragmatic Abstraction, often referred to as AHA Programming, is a development philosophy that emphasizes simplicity and practicality in software design. It encourages developers to avoid unnecessary complexity and to focus on creating solutions that are both effective and easy to understand.

Key Principles:

- **Avoid Premature Optimization**: Start with a simple and clear solution, and only optimize when necessary.
- **Keep It Simple**: Use straightforward approaches that are easy to understand and maintain.
- **Focus on the Problem**: Concentrate on solving the problem at hand rather than creating a more complex solution.
- **Use Standard Libraries**: Leverage well-established libraries and patterns that have proven track records.
- **Avoid Over-Engineering**: Resist the urge to create overly complex designs that may be harder to maintain.

Benefits:

- **Simplicity**: AHA programming leads to simpler, more understandable code.
- **Maintainability**: Code that is easy to understand is easier to maintain.
- **Flexibility**: Simpler designs are more flexible and can adapt to changes more easily.

AHA Programming, is a concept popularized by Kent C. Dodds, emphasizing simplicity and maintainability in code. Dodds advocates for:

- **Avoiding Hasty Abstractions (AHA)**: Delaying abstractions until they're necessary to avoid premature complexity.
- **WET Code**: Writing code twice before abstracting to ensure the right solution is clear.
- **Optimizing for Change**: Prioritizing flexibility over reuse, enabling more adaptable codebases.
- **Inline Complexity**: Keeping complexity in one place for easier understanding and modification.
- **Context-Specific Abstractions**: Creating abstractions tailored to the specific needs of your application, rather than generic ones.

By following these principles, developers can create more maintainable and understandable code, aligning with the goals of Pragmatic Abstraction and AHA Programming. This approach leads to codebases that are easier to work with, debug, and evolve over time.


### Conclusion

Building modern Web3 applications requires a thoughtful architecture that blends best practices from both Web2 and Web3 development. With Next.js as the framework and tools like react-query, wagmi, and viem at your disposal, you can create scalable, performant, and maintainable applications. By following principles like code collocation, URL-based state management, efficient data subscriptions, and pragmatic abstraction, your Web3 app will be ready to handle both the challenges of today and the unknowns of tomorrow.
