Mathematics in [JavaScript](/tech/javascript) can be tricky, especially when dealing with financial applications like [DeFi](/web3). Precision errors, floating-point quirks, and handling large numbers are all challenges developers must address. In this post, we'll cover key math issues in [JavaScript](/tech/javascript), best practices for handling numbers in DeFi, and tools like `bignumber.js`, `BigInt`, and `viem` utilities.

## The Basics: Floating-Point Math in JavaScript

JavaScript uses **IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic**, which introduces quirks when performing arithmetic operations. This can lead to unexpected results:

```js
console.log(0.1 + 0.2); // 0.30000000000000004
console.log(0.3 - 0.1); // 0.19999999999999998
```

### Why Is This a Problem in DeFi?

DeFi applications require **precise calculations**, especially when dealing with token balances, staking rewards, and interest rates. Small precision errors can lead to significant discrepancies in financial transactions. This is a critical concern in system development.


## Handling Precision: Decimals in DeFi

Most ERC-20 tokens and DeFi protocols use **fixed decimal places** instead of floating-point numbers. Token balances are usually represented in their smallest unit (e.g., wei for ETH, satoshis for BTC) and later formatted for human readability.

### Example: Converting Token Amounts

```js
const tokenDecimals = 18;
const rawBalance = BigInt("1000000000000000000"); // 1 ETH in wei
const formattedBalance = Number(rawBalance) / 10 ** tokenDecimals;
console.log(formattedBalance); // 1.0
```

While using JavaScript's `Number` type for such conversions works, it is prone to floating-point precision errors. A better approach is to use a **Big Number library** like `bignumber.js`, which ensures robustness, consistency, and improved readability when dealing with precise financial calculations.

### Why `bignumber.js`?
- **Arbitrary precision**: Prevents floating-point errors.
- **Performance optimized**: Faster than alternatives like `decimal.js`.
- **Compact**: Smaller than other libraries.
- **Well-maintained**: Reliable and actively supported.

These features make it an essential technology for DeFi development.

### When to Consider Alternatives:
- If only basic decimal math is needed, `big.js` is smaller and faster.
- For advanced math functions, `decimal.js` offers more capabilities.
- If working with large integers only, **native `BigInt`** is a viable alternative.

### Example: Safe Arithmetic with `bignumber.js`

```js
import BigNumber from "bignumber.js";

const a = new BigNumber("0.1");
const b = new BigNumber("0.2");
const sum = a.plus(b);

console.log(sum.toString()); // "0.3"
```

Using `bignumber.js` ensures predictable behavior and avoids floating-point inaccuracies.


## Math on [EVM](/tech/evm): Using Viem's Utilities

When working with [Ethereum](/tech/ethereum) Virtual Machine ([EVM](/tech/evm)) transactions, **Viem** provides utilities for handling numeric conversions. This is particularly important for full-stack development across blockchain systems:
