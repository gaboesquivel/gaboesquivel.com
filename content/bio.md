My name is Gabriel Esquivel, everyone calls me “Gabo”. I was born in Costa Rica in 1984 and was raised by a loving family that thought me well to respect others and to focus on solutions!.

In 2007 I started my Software Engineering studies at CenfoTec University in San José where I discovered my passion software product development and the potential of the Web Platform.

I got my first job as Web Developer building WordPress sites and about a year later I was hired as UI Engineer for americanexpress.com.

In 2010 I started Costa Rica JS, a meetup group in San José for people interested in JavaScript. At the time Node.js was starting the get traction and SPA frameworks where blooming. Today the Costa Rican JS community is the largest meetup in Central America with more than 1700 members.

In 2011 I started to work independently as a freelance developer and during the course of the years, I have had opportunity to collaborate on many different projects and played several engineering leadership roles, leading teams from the perspective of someone that has been there in the trenches; keeping a positive and friendly attitude, mentoring trying to make engineers as happy an productive as they can possibly be.

In 2017, I worked for the a neo-bank startup <a href="https://holawin.com" target="_blank">Wink</a> as a chief architect and led the formation of a world-class team and the development of the first version of the app.

While working on the banking app and I discovered blockchain technology and my mind was blown away. I started reading more about it and I haven't stopped since. I co-founded <a href="https://blockchaincr.com" target="_blank">BlockchainCR</a>, a community hub for the research, promotion, and development of blockchain based solutions. About the same time I joined at knowledge.io as head of engineering and helped the company during their ICO.

After Knowledge's ICO, I got involved in the EOSIO community; contributing to the development of the global and local ecosystem through [EOS Costa Rica](https://github.com/eoscostarica), block producer and software development company specialized in EOSIO Blockchains and Smart Contracts.</p>

<p>I'm a proponent of devops, continuous delivery, lightweight agile methodologies, lean development, modern web technologies and open source technology stacks, particularly those build on top of JavaScript (Node.js).
