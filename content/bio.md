My name is Gabriel Esquivel, everyone calls me "Gabo". I was born in Costa Rica in 1984 and was raised by a loving family that thought me well to respect others and always focus on the solution to problems.

Since I was a little child I've loved sports, specially Soccer, but also Capoeira (brazilian martial), Yoga and Surfing; I dreamed with traveling the world, meet different cultures and learning new languages; so I dedicated some time prior to Bachelors to study foreign languages and today I can communicate fluently in English, Portuguese, Italian and Spanish.

In 2007 I started my Software Engineering studies at CenfoTec University in San José where I discovered my passion software and product development and the potential of the Web Platform.

By the end of 2009 I got my first job as Web Developer building wordpress sites and around a year later I was hired as UI Engineer for americanexpress.com through an outsourcing company based in Costa Rica.

In 2010 I started Costa Rica JS, a meetup group in San José for people interested applications development with JavaScript. At the time Node.js was starting the get traction and SPA frameworks where blooming. Today the Costa Rican JS community is the largest meetup in Central America with more than 1600 members.

In 2011 I started to work independently as a freelance developer and during the course of the years I have had the opportunity to work in many different projects in multicultural, multi-timezone remote agile teams. I worked with several clients, mainly digital agencies, startups and development shops.

Through hard work, a lot of study and practice I grew from web developer with skills for client side apps to a fullstack engineer that can work end to end, from mobile apps to cloud, databases, devops automation and blockchain.

I've played the role of lead architect, agile manager and head of engineering, mentoring and leading the development team from the perspective of someone that has been there in the trenches; keeping a positive and friendly attitude, trying to make engineers as happy an productive as they can possibly be while leveraging technologies that provide competitive business advantages such as less time-to-market and better user experiences.

In 2016 I married @laubits, my beloved wife who gave me a beautiful daughter named Coral, my motivation and my happiness.

In 2017, I worked for banking startup as CTO and Chief Architect and led the formation of a world class team and the development of an alpha version of the app with one of the most modern and cost effective technology stacks en latam in financial services.

After the neobank project I started working with decentralized technology  and blockchain,  and founded <a href="https://blockchaincr.com" target="_blank">BlockchainCR</a>, a hub for research and development of blockchain based solutions.

Shortly after I joined <a href="https://knowledge.io" target="_blank">Knowledge.io</a> as Head of Engineering and Blockchain Architect, leading a team of very talented engineers based in Costa Rica. Knowledge.io is a blockchain powered knowledge sharing platform which enables consumers and experts to prove their knowledge in many areas of expertise, and earn tokens which can be redeemed for real-life rewards. The platform also contains the Q&ADS Knowledge Score Targeting enabling marketers and advertisers to target advertising at real people who have proven expertise in their areas, avoiding many issues prevalent with adtech today.

I also own a boutique consulting, custom development and staff augmentation company that works with startups and enterprise clients <a href="https://corticaltouch.com" target="_blank">Cortical Touch</a>. Our developer network is highly specialized in JavaScript Applications, DevOps and Blockchain. Our consultation service can give you perspective on the state of your architecture and give you actionable advice.
