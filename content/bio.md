My name is Gabriel Esquivel, everyone calls me "Gabo". I was born in Costa Rica in 1984 and was raised by a loving family that thought me well to respect others and always focus on the solution to problems.

Since I was a little child I've loved sports, specially Soccer, but also Capoeira (brazilian martial), Yoga and Surfing; I dreamed with traveling the world, meet different cultures and learning new languages; so I dedicated some time prior to Bachelors to study foreign languages and today I can communicate fluently in English, Portuguese, Italian and Spanish.

In 2007 I started my Software Engineering studies at CenfoTec University in San José where I discovered my passion software and product development and the potential of the Web Platform.

By the end of 2009 I got my first job as Web Developer building wordpress sites and around a year later I was hired as UI Engineer for americanexpress.com through an outsourcing company based in Costa Rica.

In 2010 I started Costa Rica JS, a meetup group in San José for people interested in development with JavaScript. At the time Node.js was starting the get traction and SPA frameworks where blooming. Today the Costa Rican JS community is the largest meetup in Central America with more than 1700 members.

In 2011 I started to work independently as a freelance developer and during the course of the years I have had the opportunity to work in many different projects in multicultural, multi-timezone remote agile teams. I worked with several clients, mainly digital agencies, startups and development shops.

Through hard work, a lot of study and practice I grew from web developer with skills for client side apps to a fullstack engineer that can work end to end, from mobile apps to cloud, databases, devops automation and blockchain.

In 2016 I married @laubits, my beloved wife who gave me a beautiful daughter named Coral, my biggest motivation.

In 2017, I worked for banking startup as interim CTO and Chief Architect and led the formation of a world class team and the development of an alpha version of the app with one of the most modern and cost effective technology stacks en latam in financial services.

After the neobank project I started studying decentralized systems and blockchain, and founded <a href="https://blockchaincr.com" target="_blank">BlockchainCR</a>, a community hub for the research, promotion and development of blockchain based solutions.

Shortly after I joined knowledge.io as head of engineering and blockchain architect, leading a team of very talented engineers. I helped the company through their ICO and contributed to the design of the cloud services for their Ads Platform and Marketplace, and the Knowledge Ethereum wallet: a centralized wallet solution for all knowledge users and clients, focusing mainly in cloud security and user experience.
