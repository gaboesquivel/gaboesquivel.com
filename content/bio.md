My name is Gabriel Esquivel, everyone calls me “Gabo”. I'm a proponent of decentralized applications, open source technology stacks, devops, continuous delivery, lightweight agile methodologies, lean development and modern web technologies.

Things I do:

- Fullstack hands on programming.
- Infrastructure, DevOps and reliability engineering.
- Leading and coaching development teams.
- Technical insight in support of strategic decision making.
- Overseeing technical execution from prototype to production.

In 2007 I started my software engineering studies at CenfoTec University in San José where I discovered my passion software product development and the potential of the web platform.

In 2009 I got my first job as web developer building WordPress sites and about a year later I was hired as UI Engineer for americanexpress.com.

In 2010 I started Costa Rica JS, a meetup group in San José for people interested in JavaScript. At the time Node.js was starting the get traction and SPA frameworks where blooming. Today the Costa Rican JS community is the largest meetup in Central America with more than 1700 members.

In 2011 I started to work independently as a freelance developer and during the course of the years, I have had opportunity to collaborate on many different projects and played several engineering leadership roles, leading teams from the perspective of someone that has been there in the trenches; keeping a positive and friendly attitude, mentoring trying to make engineers as happy an productive as they can possibly be.

In 2017, I worked for the a neo-bank startup <a href="https://holawink.com" target="_blank">Wink</a> as a chief architect and led the formation of a world-class team and the development of the first version of the app.

Also in 2017, I co-founded <a href="https://blockchaincr.com" target="_blank">BlockchainCR</a>,  a community hub for knowledge sharing, promoting and studying blockchain technologies and decentralized applications.

Working closely with stakeholders and developers in the design and development of software applications, taking ideas from conception to production and successful execution.</p>
