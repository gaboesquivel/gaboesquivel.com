My name is Gabriel Esquivel, everyone calls me “Gabo”. I was born in Costa Rica in 1984 and was raised by a loving family that thought me well to respect others and always focuses on the solution to problems.

Since I was a little child I’ve loved sports, especially Soccer, but also Capoeira (Brazilian martial), Yoga and Surfing; I dreamed of traveling the world, meet different cultures and learning new languages; so I dedicated some time prior to Bachelors to study foreign languages and today I can communicate fluently in English, Portuguese, Italian and Spanish.

In 2007 I started my Software Engineering studies at CenfoTec University in San José where I discovered my passion software and product development and the potential of the Web Platform.

I got my first job as Web Developer building WordPress sites and around a year later I was hired as UI Engineer for americanexpress.com through an outsourcing company based in Costa Rica.

In 2010 I started Costa Rica JS, a meetup group in San José for people interested in development with JavaScript. At the time Node.js was starting the get traction and SPA frameworks where blooming. Today the Costa Rican JS community is the largest meetup in Central America with more than 1700 members.

In 2011 I started to work independently as a freelance developer and during the course of the years, I have had opportunity to collaborate on open source and many different projects in multicultural, multi-timezone remote teams; and played several engineering leadership roles, leading teams from the perspective of someone that has been there in the trenches; keeping a positive and friendly attitude, mentoring, trying to make engineers as happy an productive as they can possibly be.

In 2016 I married @laubits, my beloved wife who gave me a beautiful daughter named Coral, my biggest motivation.

In 2017, I worked for a neo-bank startup ( holawink.com ) as interim CTO and Chief Architect and led the formation of a world-class team and the development of the first version of the app, leveraging AWS Cloud, Serverless, Infra-as-Code and React Native.

While working on the neo-bank app and I discovered blockchain technology and my mind was blown away. I started reading more about it and haven't been able to stop since. After the neo-bank project I co-founded <a href="https://blockchaincr.com" target="_blank">BlockchainCR</a>, a community hub for the research, promotion, and development of blockchain based solutions and about as the same time I joined at knowledge.io as head of engineering and helped the company during their ICO.

After Knowledge's ICO, I got involved in the EOS community contributing to the development of the global and local ecosystem through [EOS Costa Rica] (https://github.com/eoscostarica), Costa Rica's EOS community and block producer candidate.

I provide consultation and development services to startups and enterprise clients. [Get in Touch](/contact)
