My name is Gabriel Esquivel, everyone calls me “Gabo”. I’m a proponent of decentralized applications, open-source technology stacks, devops culture, lightweight agile methodologies and modern web technologies.

Things I do:

- Fullstack hands-on programming.
- Infrastructure, DevOps and reliability engineering.
- Leading and coaching development teams.
- Technical insight in support of strategic decision making.
- Overseeing technical execution from prototype to production.

In 2007 I started my software engineering studies at CenfoTec University in San José where I discovered my passion software product development and the potential of the web platform.

In 2009 I got my first job as web developer building WordPress sites and about a year later I was hired as UI Engineer for americanexpress.com.

In 2010 I started Costa Rica JS, a meetup group in San José for people interested in JavaScript. At the time Node.js was starting the get traction and SPA frameworks where blooming. Today the Costa Rican JS community is the largest meetup in Central America with more than 2000 members.
