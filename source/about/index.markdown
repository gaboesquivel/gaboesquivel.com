I am a software developer with solid background in front end engineering and interactive technologies.  I can help you define clear software requirements based on your business goals, architect and develop your web and/or mobile application.

I&#8217;ve successfully provided remote development services to several clients including bureauoftrade.com ( an e-commerce startup based in Palo Alto, CA ), jsgeeks.com ( a London-based company providing specialized software services in web and mobile areas ), thewonderfactory.com ( an interactive agency in New York City ), gridium.com ( energy data analytics startup based in Menlo Park, CA ) and oktara.com ( a software development company founded in San Jose, Costa Rica ). For about a year I worked as Creative Engineer at americanexpress.com on behalf of Digitas and my work experience includes clients such as SunTrust, Evoxac, Staples, Tide and AMC Networks.

Organizer / Instigator at <a title="Javascript Community in Costa Rica" href="http://costaricajs.org" target="_blank">CostaRicaJS</a> and <a title="Javascript Community in Panama City" href="http://meetup.com/panamajs" target="_blank">PanamaJS</a>, open groups for developers to hang out and stay up to date with the technologies, techniques and frameworks related to javascript.

I am also interested in a wide range of topics related to software development, lean startups and business development, design, ux &#8211; usability, data visualization, marketing and distribution. I’m a builder at heart and entrepreneur.
