I&#8217;m very excited to announce that we&#8217;re starting a data visualization meetup group in Costa Rica!

At the last <a title="Hack Hackers San José" href="http://www.meetup.com/Hacks-Hackers-San-Jose/" target="_blank">Hack Hackers SJO</a> event I finally had the pleasure to meet <a href="http://www.behance.net/Engelhardt" target="_blank">Yuri Engelhardt</a> in person after months of exchanging emails and ideas about data visualization in Costa Rica. Yuri is the co-founder of <a href="http://showmethedata.nl" target="_blank">Show Me Data</a>, an annual multidisciplinary course and public event that brings together the University of Amsterdam (UvA) and the Utrecht Graduate School of Visual Art and Design (maHKU) students to get familiar with the world of data visualization.

Over a couple of beers Yuri expressed me his idea of watching and discussing together MOOC videos from his video library, I thought that was really rad! &#8230; I´m very interested in data visualization and all the possibilities you have to make the world a better place using these technologies. After the event we exchanged  a couple more emails on the topic and we decided to create a meetup group to bring together all professionals and data visualization enthusiasts ****to share our knowledge and ideas. That&#8217;s how the <a title="Data Visualization in Costa Rica" href="http://www.meetup.com/Data-Visualization-Costa-Rica/" target="_blank">Costa Rica Data Visualization Group</a> was born.

Data Visualization Costa Rica  is a non-profit professional group that aims to meet monthly to discuss data visualization, data communication, infographics, exploratory data analysis, charts and graphs, perceptual psychology, and more! Our members are data journalists, programmers, data scientists, business intelligence professionals, and others who tell stories with data. Meeting topics will vary and range from tutorials on basic concepts and their applications, to success stories from local practitioners, to discussions of tools, new technologies, and best practices.

<!--more-->We believe in data visualization, information design and digital media for social and environmental causes – e.g. in data journalism, education, health, civil rights, sustainability citizen engagement, transparency and accountability.

Check out **Graphics with a Cause**, a presentation by Yuri and Ekaterina Yudin on April 12th 2012, at the Information Design Conference 2012 in London.
