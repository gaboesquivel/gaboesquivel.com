I&#8217;m very excited to announce that we&#8217;re starting a data visualization meetup group in Costa Rica!

Data Visualization Costa Rica is a non-profit professional group that aims to meet monthly to discuss data visualization, data communication, infographics, exploratory data analysis, charts and graphs, perceptual psychology, and more! It is gathering point for data journalists, programmers, data scientists, business intelligence professionals, and others who tell stories with data. Meetup topics will vary and range from tutorials on basic concepts and their applications, to success stories from local practitioners, to discussions of tools, new technologies, and best practices.

We believe in data visualization, information design and digital media for social and environmental causes – e.g. in education, health, civil rights, sustainability citizen engagement, transparency and accountability.
