Continuous delivery is practice in software development in which development teams work in a way that allows companies to update their systems at any point in time or continuously through automated processes, the system’s code base is always deployable and tested.

##Why is it important?

Continuous delivery is a more efficient way to build software as it enables a team to get constant feedback on the application’s changes and updates, allowing you detect problems early and consequently reducing costs and deployment frictions. It also gives the team a realistic view of development progress instead of relying on perceptions.  

It gives a company the ability to react quickly and respond to change. Having fluid a process of software development allows you to make changes on your strategy more easily and rapidly. 

##Continuous Integration and Automated Development Operations

In order achieve continuous delivery you need high automation of the delivery process and the developers have to continuously integrate their code, at least once a day. Successful integration is determined by an integration server that builds the system and runs the test suite every time new code is added, if tests failed the dev team receives a notification, this allows the team to fix the problem as soon as it appears.
