After years of working as an independent software consultant I decided to partner up with web specialists in Costa Rica and start a software consulting firm specialized in JavaScript Applications. The name of the company is Cortical Touch. Our vision is to become one of the best modern web firms. We work with top and passionate developers to deliver high quality services.

At Cortical Touch we develop custom software using lightweight agile methodologies working closely with you to meet your business goals. We count with experienced and skilled JavaScript, Agile, DevOps and Web specialists to support you during implementation of strategic milestone projects, whether you are starting from scratch or need help improving an existing code base.

Cortical Touch is a fully distributed team. We have no office, no headquarters, and no fixed working hours. We follow agile methodologies to manage our projects and we participate actively in open source and software development communities.
