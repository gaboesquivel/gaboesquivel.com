## The Lean Startup

Eric Ries defines a startup as an organization dedicated to creating something new under conditions of extreme uncertainty. This is just as true for one person in a garage or a group of seasoned professionals in a Fortune 500 boardroom. What they have in common is a mission to penetrate that fog of uncertainty to discover a successful path to a sustainable business.

Rather than wasting time creating elaborate business plans, The Lean Startup offers entrepreneurs &#8211; in companies of all sizes &#8211; a way to test their vision continuously, to adapt and adjust before itâ€™s too late. Ries provides a scientific approach to creating and managing successful startups in a age when companies need to innovate more than ever.

Do one important thing: make better, faster business decisions. Vastly better, faster business decisions. Bringing principles from lean manufacturing and agile development to the process of innovation, the Lean Startup helps companies succeed in a business landscape riddled with risk. This book shows you how.
