The JavaScript development ecosystem is vibrant and it´s rapidly growing, there's a myriad of libraries, frameworks and tools that are constantly evolving and every day new solutions, techniques and modules are published. The language itself is evolving quickly with new ECMAScript versions, native browser support for those specifications and a stack transpilers and polyfills. 

This is not a specific to JavaScript, technology in general evolves fast and open source even faster. The following is a list of useful resoures and tips to keep up to date.

## The Changelog Nightly
A daily email report on the most relevant activity on Github. Adam Stacoviak from The Changelog has taken over GitHubArchive.org, an OSS project from Ilya Grigorik, which records the public GitHub timeline, archives it, and makes it easily accessible for further analysis. It ships every night at 10pm CT — and unearths the hottest new repos on GitHub before they blow up. It’s nerd to the core and in your inbox each night. [changelog.com/nightly](https://changelog.com/nightly/)

Listen to the interview with Ilya on [The Changelog #144](http://thechangelog.com/144) for more details about GitHub Archive and Changelog Nightly.

The site includes numerous useful links, a great list of people to follow on twitter and recommendations from top front-end developers on how to keep up with front technologies. [uptodate.frontendrescue.org](http://uptodate.frontendrescue.org/) 

## Engineering Podcasts
I love podcasts, you can listen to them while you drive or walk and play them in the background while you work. Sometimes I listen to them while taking a bath or chilling on my couch. I really can't think of better way to make dead times productive. I wrote an article about [my favorite javascript and open source podcasts](/blog/2012/recommended-podcasts-screencasts-and-blogs/).
