Coming back to Costa Rica and enjoy my country while working on software applications is one of the best decisions I ever made.

Feel free to contact me if you are looking for advise or network with the development community. > <a title="Silicon Beach - Costa Rica" href="http://bit.ly/SiliconBeachCR " target="_blank">http://bit.ly/SiliconBeachCR</a>
