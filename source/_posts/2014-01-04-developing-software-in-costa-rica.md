Coming back to Costa Rica and enjoy my country while working on software applications is one of the best decisions I ever made. Check out these pictures I took with my phone at Playa Manzanillo, near to Santa Teresa - Mal Pa√≠s, a natural paradise with world class surfing that ranks among the most beautiful beaches of Costa Rica and you'll agree is the best place to live or invest in the country.

Santa Teresa was recently awarded by Trip Advisor as the #1 highest-rated travel location in all of both Central and South America. Malpais and Montezuma both have many of the best restaurants in the entire country, since many international chefs have moved to the area. The area is also a major center of Costa Rica Yoga with over a dozen places to learn/practice and many yoga retreats and surf+yoga retreat combinations.
