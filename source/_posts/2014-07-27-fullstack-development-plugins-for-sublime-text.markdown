## Sublime-JSHint

This plugin allows you to check your JavaScript code for nasty errors, coding conventions and other goodies. It relies on JSHint, a fork of JSLint (developed by Douglas Crockford). The linter is itself written in JavaScript, so you'll need something (node.js) to interpret JavaScript code outside the browser.

JSHint is a community-driven tool to detect errors and potential problems in JavaScript code and to enforce your team's coding conventions. It is very flexible so you can easily adjust it to your particular coding guidelines and the environment you expect your code to execute in. JSHint is open source and will always stay this way.

The goal of this project is to help JavaScript developers write complex programs without worrying about typos and language gotchas.
