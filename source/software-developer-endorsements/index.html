                <p>I've known Gabo as a result of his huge efforts with JSMeetups and WebCR. He's the rare sort who is a natural born organizer and leader – but who also knows his code! He's demonstrated to be both passionate about web development and breaking
                    technologies in addition to creative in finding solutions to problems. I'd look forward to collaborating with Gabo anytime and would highly recommend him for contract work.</p>

                <p>Gabo never ceased to impress us with his spotlessly clean code, helpful documentation, and eye for seeing and acting on the most minute areas for improvement. He's routinely gone above-and-beyond supporting his code and providing bug fixes
                    with an unbelievably upbeat attitude. He took huge initiative to bring our site up-to-date with the latest in HTML5 and CSS standards while supporting legacy browsers. On top of that, he was always available to talk to and highly professional

                <p>Gabriel has the rare ability to solve problems that have left other developers scratching their heads. He was a key player on a very difficult development project and maintained his professionalism throughout. He is a great technical resource
                    and can articulate Development practice and theory eloquently. His linguistic skills are also a major plus when it comes to dealing with complex scopes and client communication. It was a pleasure to work with him and I would do so

                <p>Working with Gabriel has been a real pleasure. He has demonstrated to be a highly professional and proactive developer, as he not only seeks to complete his work, but always puts the effort in doing it right - by following best practices
                    and thinking in the overall architecture or goal, or by providing solutions to previously unsolved problems.</p>
                <p>He's a great team player and what I really like about him is that he always keep a positive attitude even in the most difficult and stressful of situations, which helps keeping a good energy/vibe within the team. His teammates have always
