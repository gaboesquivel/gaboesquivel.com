      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on software development for 10 years now and along the way, I&amp;rsquo;ve had the opportunity to collaborate on several open source projects and also worked on many non-open source projects where we used Github as our version control repository, on small and large teams.
On my journey, I&amp;rsquo;ve followed different workflows depending on the project and today I want to share with you what I consider to be a effective and pragmatic workflow for building and maintaining good quality software that can be applied to any project.</description>
