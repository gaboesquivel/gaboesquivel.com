      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on software development for 10 years now and along the way, I&amp;rsquo;ve had the opportunity to collaborate on several open source projects and also worked on many non-open source projects where we used Github as our version control repository, on small and large teams.
On my journey, I&amp;rsquo;ve followed different workflows depending on the project and today I want to share with you what I consider to be a effective and pragmatic workflow for building and maintaining good quality software that can be applied to any project.</description>

      <title>On Continuous Delivery</title>
      <link>https://gaboesquivel.com/blog/2015/on-continuous-delivery/</link>

      <guid>https://gaboesquivel.com/blog/2015/on-continuous-delivery/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuous delivery is practice in software development in which development teams work in a way that allows companies to update their systems at any point in time or continuously through automated processes, the system’s code base is always deployable and tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-is-it-important&#34;&gt;Why is it important?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous delivery is a more efficient way to build software as it enables a team to get constant feedback on the application’s changes and updates, allowing you detect problems early and consequently improve quality, reduce costs and deployment frictions. This constant feedback also gives the team a realistic view of development progress instead of relying on perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous Delivery gives a company the ability to react quickly and respond to change. Having fluid a process of software development allows you to make changes on your strategy more easily and rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Best Practices for Designing RESTful APIs</title>
      <link>https://gaboesquivel.com/blog/2015/best-practices-for-designing-restful-apis/</link>

      <description>An application-programming interface (API) exposes functionality of a software application for other software clients to use. Through APIs applications interact with each other and share data without any user knowledge or intervention.
Modern web applications typically have RESTful JSON APIs. REST stands for Representational State Transfer and it is a software architecture style consisting of guidelines and best practices for building scalable web services. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and it is a minimal, readable format for structuring data.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Gulp.js</title>
      <link>https://gaboesquivel.com/blog/2014/introduction-to-gulp.js/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Automation of repetitive and critical tasks is key to develop a successful software product. Automated tasks will minimize software cost, reduce software delivery time as well as improving the product quality and reduce human error. Investing time in automating tasks will allow you to focus on developing features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“War is of vital importance to the state; hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sun Tzu, Art of War&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I will introduce you to Gulp.js, a javascript task runner that helps you automate your development process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;##Setting Up your Web App Build System&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When developing modern web applications there are critical tasks you want to automate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;testing: code linting, unit testing, e2e tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;css preprocessing ( sass, less, …)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;optimization: concatenating and minifying css and scripts, compressing new or modified images, &amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deploying updates to a staging or production server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many tools that will help you automate these tasks. Which one to choose? Grunt, Gulp, Brunch, Broccoli,…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2012 Grunt.js came out and it was quickly adopted by the community, plugins started to proliferate and it became king for task automation on the client side, playing well with Bower and Yeoman. Like many other developers I’ve been using Grunt on my projects and it gets the job done but recently I started to use Gulp, another open source project with faster build times and a Unix/Node philosophical approach to solve problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gulp.js focuses on code over configuration. By harnessing the power of Node streams, it enables faster build times by avoiding the need to write temporary files to disk. This is one of the main differences with Grunt. Stream instances are basically Unix pipes. They can be readable, writable or both and are easy to reason about &amp;ndash; you can pipe a readable stream to a writable stream by doing readableStream.pipe(writableStream).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Streams come to us from the earliest days of unix and have proven themselves over the decades as a dependable way to compose large systems out of small components that do one thing well.&lt;br&gt;
You can then plug the output of one stream to the input of another and use libraries that operate abstractly on streams to institute higher-level flow control.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;substack&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Overview of Angular Generators – April 2014</title>
      <link>https://gaboesquivel.com/blog/2014/overview-of-angular-generators-april-2014/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://gaboesquivel.com/blog/2014/overview-of-angular-generators-april-2014/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a short and opinionated review of the AngularJS generators on npm as of April 19th, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of generators on npm and it&amp;rsquo;s a little hard to decide which one to use or fork, since we don&amp;rsquo;t want to reinvent the wheel. Currently the only way to compare them is to try them one by one and that&amp;rsquo;s a very time consuming task. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll try to give you an overview of some generators I&amp;rsquo;ve explored recently hoping it will save you some time. I’ll follow &lt;a href=&#34;http://cliffmeyers.com/blog/2013/4/21/code-organization-angularjs-javascript&#34;&gt;Cliff Meyer&amp;rsquo;s Code Organization Categorization&lt;/a&gt; to describe their code structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most generators still use the &amp;ldquo;Sock Drawer&amp;rdquo; directory organization, an approach that I personally avoid, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t scale well but it works for small projects. I prefer a modular structure as suggested on latest &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XXMvReO8-Awi1EZXAXS4PzDzdNvV6pGcuaF4Q9821Es/pub&#34;&gt;Google&amp;rsquo;s Best Practice Recommendations for Angular App Structure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the benefits of modularization are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encapsulation:&lt;/strong&gt; Code, styles and tests related to specific feature will be contained on the same directory.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Context:&lt;/strong&gt;  Code lives in given context by feature. This is specially important to developers new to the application, who will find it easier to connect the dots.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Code Reusabilty:&lt;/strong&gt; You would be able to reuse modules across projects and clients, Eg mobile and web-client could share autentication modules or resources ( models ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of Angular generators and their characteristics (some of them are fullstack generators):&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Developing Software in Paradise, aka Costa Rica</title>
      <link>https://gaboesquivel.com/blog/2014/developing-software-in-paradise-aka-costa-rica/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Coming back to Costa Rica and enjoy my country while working on software applications is one of the best decisions I ever made. Check out these pictures I took with my phone at Playa Manzanillo, near to Santa Teresa - Mal País, a natural paradise with world class surfing that ranks among the most beautiful beaches of Costa Rica and you&amp;rsquo;ll agree is the best place to live or invest in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Santa Teresa was recently awarded by Trip Advisor as the #1 highest-rated travel location in all of both Central and South America. Malpais and Montezuma both have many of the best restaurants in the entire country, since many international chefs have moved to the area. The area is also a major center of Costa Rica Yoga with over a dozen places to learn/practice and many yoga retreats and surf+yoga retreat combinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Elion Chin, co-founder of MoodLogic - one of the first online music recommendation systems, is leading &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; src=&#34;http://bit.ly/SiliconBeachCR&#34;&gt;Silicon Beach&lt;/a&gt; a forum for entrepreneurs &amp; people looking to invest in, work at, advise or network with startups in Costa Rica to promote the technology talent of Costa Rica and drive the start-up culture in a fulfilling and healthy environment to deliver the best.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Choosing the Data Store for Your Web App</title>
      <link>https://gaboesquivel.com/blog/2013/choosing-the-data-store-for-your-web-app/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://gaboesquivel.com/blog/2013/choosing-the-data-store-for-your-web-app/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When choosing a database for your application, you need ask yourself many questions and there are important rules about Data Architecture&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there’s no standard solution that fits all&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the business and it’s data defines the architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you need to find the right tool that does job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can use multiple databases, different types depending on the characteristics of each data subset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very important to decide carefully, after your application grown it could be very difficult to change. The CAP theorem, also known as Brewer’s theorem, states that it is impossible for a distributed computer system to simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistency (all nodes see the same data at the same time)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Availability (a guarantee that every request receives a response about whether it was successful or failed)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partition tolerance (the system continues to operate despite arbitrary message loss or failure of part of the system)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;center-align-wrapper&#34;&gt;
&lt;img  alt=&#34;CAP Theorem - Venn Diagram&#34; src=&#34;https://gaboesquivel.com/img/2013/09/cap_venn.png&#34; width=&#34;547&#34; height=&#34;520&#34; /&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;
Once you have defined which of those guarantees is less important for your app and can be sacrificed, you have a smaller subset of options to choose from. However this not the only thing you need to consider, you may want to use a specific framework such as Hibernate, Spring, Django or WordPress, and take advantage of the of-the-shelf capabilities, in that case you want to use a SQL database.</description>
