# Agent Skill Writing Standards

## Scope
Applies when creating/modifying files in `.cursor/skills/`. Skills extend agent with narrow, reusable expertise for a single primary topic.

## Core Principles

### 1. One Primary Topic per Skill
MUST represent one primary topic with independent versioning. If two things version independently, they MUST be separate skills. Cross-technology guidance belongs in `references/` as integration notes.

### 2. Versioned Skill Directories
MUST encode major version: `<primary-topic>-v<major>` (e.g., `fastify-v4`, `openapi-v3`, `foundry-v1`)

Avoid: Unversioned directories, minor/patch versions in names, multiple topics in one directory, mixing incompatible major versions

### 3. Declarative Over Instructional
State what is true or must hold, not how to reason. ✅ "Use queryKey factories" ❌ "First analyze the code, then decide…"

### 4. Patterns Over Examples
Prefer stable patterns over concrete examples. If examples necessary: keep minimal/universal, avoid repo-specific paths, avoid copying real code.

### 5. Hard Rules Sparingly
Use MUST/NEVER only when violations cause real harm: bugs, security risk, vendor lock-in, severe DX regression.

### 6. Explicit Assumptions
MUST state what it targets: version scope (e.g., v5+, v4.x), runtime constraints (Node 18+, ESM-first, Edge-compatible). Avoid timeless/ambiguous claims.

### 7. Trade-offs, Not Dogma
When recommendation is preference rather than constraint, explain why.

## Structure Requirements

### Required Files
- Live in versioned directory: `<primary-topic>-v<major>`
- Include `SKILL.md` as entry point

### Minimal Skill Template
```md
# Skill: <name>

## Scope
- What this skill applies to
- What it explicitly does NOT cover

## Assumptions
- Versions and runtime expectations

## Principles
- Declarative, stable truths
- Patterns with trade-offs where relevant

## Constraints
- MUST / SHOULD / AVOID (only when justified)

## Interactions
- How this skill composes with others
- Known intentional conflicts or overrides
```

### Supporting Files
- `PATTERNS.md` – Stable patterns (optional)
- `references/` – Integration notes, adapters, compatibility guidance

### Integration References
Put integration notes under the skill that owns the primary decision surface:
- "How to use X from Y" → Put under **Y** (the caller/host)
- "How to implement X across many hosts" → Put under **X** (the specification/standard)
- Neither side owns it → Create dedicated integration skill versioned by integration contract

Avoid duplicating integration guidance. Choose one canonical location and link from the other.

## Self-Containment
MUST be self-contained and portable across projects:
- ✅ Cross-skill references (link to another skill's `SKILL.md`)
- ✅ Links to external documentation (official docs, specifications)
- ❌ Links to repo-specific files or internal code paths
- ❌ Mentions of project structure or implementation details
- ❌ Examples that reference internal codebases

## Optimization for Retrieval
Skills are machine-read first. Prefer: bullets, short sentences, consistent vocabulary, clear section headers. Avoid: long paragraphs, storytelling or metaphors.

## Composition and Conflicts
**Design for composition**: Assume multiple skills may apply simultaneously, global Cursor rules override skills. Avoid: re-explaining language fundamentals, redefining formatting/linting rules.

**Make conflicts explicit**: If skill intentionally diverges from common conventions, state it plainly.

## Relationship with Rules
| Layer  | Purpose                                  |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Rules  | Global, opinionated, override everything |
| Skills | Local expertise, patterns, constraints   |
| Model  | Reasoning and synthesis                  |

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] One primary topic
- [ ] Versioned directory name (`<topic>-v<major>`)
- [ ] `SKILL.md` present and complete
- [ ] Declarative statements (not instructional)
- [ ] Patterns favored over examples
- [ ] Hard rules justified and minimal
- [ ] Versions and assumptions explicit
- [ ] Interactions and conflicts documented
- [ ] Integration notes in `references/` (if needed)
- [ ] Optimized for retrieval (bullets, concise)
- [ ] Self-contained (no repo-specific references)

## Bottom Line
Great agent skills are boring, precise, scoped, and opinionated only where it matters. If a skill reads like a tutorial or general documentation, it is doing too much.
