# Content Linking Strategy

## Link Categories & Hierarchy

### Domain Specializations (Highest Priority)
Link broad domain words to specialization pages:
- DeFi and web3 → `/web3` 
- AI → `/ai`
- Frontend → `/frontend`
- Backend, DB and cloud → `/backend`
- Mobile, React Native → `/mobile`
- Technical leadership → `/lead`
- Startup development → `/startups`
- Enterprise/institutional work → `/institutions`

### Project Implementations (Medium Priority)
Link specific project mentions to project pages:
- "BitLauncher" → `/project/bitlauncher`
- "Opyn protocol" → `/project/opyn`
- "Masterbots" → `/project/masterbots`

### Technology Mentions (Lower Priority)
Link specific technology mentions to tech pages:
- "Next.js" → `/tech/next-js` (not generic `/tech`)
- "Supabase" → `/tech/supabase`
- "GraphQL" → `/tech/graphql`

## Precise Linking Rules

### Domain Concepts Over Technologies
When a concept belongs to a domain specialization, link to that specialization page rather than a technology page:
- "DeFi primitives" → `/web3` (not to `/project/opyn` or `/tech`)
- "Blockchain indexing" → `/web3` (not to `/tech/blockchain`)
- "AI assistants" → `/ai` (not to `/tech/llm`)
- "Startup MVP" → `/startups` (not to specific startup projects)
- "Enterprise compliance" → `/institutions` (not to specific institution projects)

### Specific Tech Links
When mentioning specific technologies, link to their dedicated tech landing pages:
- "Next.js App Router" → `/tech/next-js` (specific tech page, not generic `/tech`)
- "PostgreSQL" → `/tech/postgresql`
- "React" → `/tech/react`

### Project Name Recognition
Only link explicit project name mentions to project pages:
- Link "BitLauncher analytics dashboard" → `/project/bitlauncher`
- Don't link "our analytics dashboard" to a project page unless project is explicitly named

### Chronological Integrity
Always respect publication dates—never link to projects in posts dated before the project existed.

## Balanced Linking Implementation

- **Quality over Quantity:** Each link must provide genuine value to the reader
- **Non-Repetition:** Use only one link per target page within a single blog post
- **Natural Context:** Links must feel organic within the content's flow
- **Diverse Anchors:** Use descriptive and varied anchor text that accurately describes the linked content
- **Limit Per Post:** Maximum 3-5 total links per blog post (across all categories)
- **Hierarchy Distribution:** Prioritize domain specialization links (1-2), then add project links (0-1) and tech links (0-2) as relevant
- **Priority Order:** Domain Specialization > Project > Technology

## Priority Content

Focus first on:
- High-traffic blog posts
- Recent content (2023-2025)
- Posts with strong SEO potential based on search trends and keyword research
