- Project-based headings that combine technology and project names
- First-person storytelling with specific pivotal moments and realizations
- Balance of technical details with personal values and human impact
- Cross-linking to related expertise areas
- Clear page categorization (Experience, Professional, Portfolio) for improved user navigation
- Consistent URL structure and semantic HTML across all landing pages

## Cross-Content Linking Architecture

### Blog to Domain Specialization (Highest Priority)
Link domain concepts to specialization pages:
- Link "DeFi applications" → `/web3`
- Link "AI assistants" → `/ai`
- Max 1-2 domain specialization links per post

### Blog to Projects (Medium Priority)
Link specific named projects to their pages:
- Only link explicitly named projects: "BitLauncher" → `/project/bitlauncher`
- Respect chronology (only link to projects that existed at publication time)
- Max 0-1 project links per post

### Blog to Tech (Lower Priority)
Link specific tech mentions to dedicated tech pages:
- Link "Next.js" → `/tech/next-js` (not generic `/tech`)
- Link "PostgreSQL" → `/tech/postgresql`
- Max 0-2 technology links per post

### Landing Page Interlinking
- **Specialization to Projects:** Link domain expertise to concrete project implementations
- **Specialization to Specialization:** Connect related domains (e.g., `/web3` → `/fullstack`, `/startups` → `/institutions`, `/lead` → `/startups`)
- **Project to Tech:** Connect project implementations to specific technologies used

## Content Strategy by Category

- **Experience Pages:** Emphasize domain expertise with practical achievements and project examples
- **Professional Pages:** Focus on career narrative, skills progression, and professional background
- **Portfolio Pages:** Showcase concrete implementations, technical decisions, and measurable outcomes
- Use structured headings, bullet highlights, and concise sections for readability across all pages

## Meta + Open Graph Strategy

- Custom meta titles + descriptions per page category
- Category-specific OG image templates for consistent branding
- Use featured project images for portfolio-related pages
- Include structured data (JSON-LD) for enhanced search results

## Analytics & Continuous Optimization

- Track user journey through page categories (Experience → Projects → Tech)
- Monitor engagement metrics by page category
- Analyze which blog-to-landing links generate the most engagement
- Test different linking strategies to optimize for both user experience and SEO
- Regularly refine content organization based on analytics insights

## External Inbound Link Strategy

- **Target Precise Landing Pages:** Direct external links to the most specific relevant landing page rather than homepage
- **Domain Specialization Priority:** Prioritize inbound links to domain specialization pages (/web3, /ai, /frontend, etc.) as they have long-term value
- **Technology Page Targeting:** For technology-specific mentions in external content, target specific tech pages (/tech/next-js, /tech/supabase)
- **Hierarchical Referral Mapping:**
  - When mentioned in broad domain contexts → Link to specialization pages
  - When mentioned with specific projects → Link to project pages
  - When mentioned with specific technologies → Link to tech pages
- **Guest Posting Strategy:** When writing external content, link back following the same hierarchy:
  - For domain concepts: Link to specialization pages first
  - For specific project mentions: Link to project pages
  - For specific tech discussions: Link to tech pages
- **Content Development:** Create shareable expert content aligned with each specialization domain to attract high-quality backlinks
