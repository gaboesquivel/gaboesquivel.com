      <description>&lt;p&gt;Coming back to Costa Rica and enjoy my country while working on software applications is one of the best decisions I ever made. Check out these pictures I took with my phone at Playa Manzanillo, near to Santa Teresa - Mal País, a natural paradise with world class surfing that ranks among the most beautiful beaches of Costa Rica and you&amp;rsquo;ll agree is the best place to live or invest in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

Santa Teresa was recently awarded by Trip Advisor as the #1 highest-rated travel location in all of both Central and South America. Malpais and Montezuma both have many of the best restaurants in the entire country, since many international chefs have moved to the area. The area is also a major center of Costa Rica Yoga with over a dozen places to learn/practice and many yoga retreats and surf+yoga retreat combinations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I’m very excited to announce that we’re starting a data visualization meetup group in Costa Rica!
At Hack/Hackers San José event I finally had the pleasure to meet Yuri Engelhardt in person after months of exchanging emails and ideas about data visualization. Yuri is the co-founder of Show Me Data, an annual multidisciplinary course and public event that brings together the University of Amsterdam (UvA) and the Utrecht Graduate School of Visual Art and Design (maHKU) students to get familiar with the world of data visualization.</description>
