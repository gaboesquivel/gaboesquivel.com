        Web3 Experience
      </h1>

      <p className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert">
        My journey into Web3 began after years of working in traditional
        financial systems, where I witnessed firsthand the inefficiencies of how
        money moves between institutions. What drew me to blockchain wasn't just
        the technology itself, but its potential to transform how we create and
        exchange value. I remember the moment in 2017 when I first deployed a
        smart contract—watching code autonomously execute financial logic
        without intermediaries felt revolutionary. Since then, I've combined my{' '}

        with blockchain knowledge to build systems that emphasize transparency,
        user ownership, and permissionless innovation—values that align deeply
        with my belief that technology should expand access rather than restrict
        it.

        AMEX & Mobile Neobank

      <p className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert">
        My understanding of financial systems began taking shape at American
        Express (2009-2012), where I worked as a UI Engineer on their credit
        card platforms. Beyond just building interfaces, I had the opportunity
        to collaborate directly with payment processing teams, giving me a rare
        glimpse into how money actually flows through traditional systems. I was
        surprised by the layers of intermediaries and manual processes hidden
        behind what users experienced as simple transactions. These observations
        planted the seeds for what would later become a fascination with more
        efficient financial models.

        , Costa Rica's first digital bank. Building a fully-regulated neobank
        from scratch was eye-opening—I saw firsthand how challenging it was to
        innovate within established regulatory frameworks. While we succeeded in
        creating a more user-friendly banking experience, I found myself
        increasingly wondering if financial services could be reimagined more
        fundamentally. The limitations we encountered with traditional banking
        partners made me receptive to the decentralized finance concepts I would
        later explore.

        Entering Web3: Knowledge ICO

        —one of the earliest platforms attempting to tokenize human expertise.
        What excited me about this project was its potential to create more
        direct relationships between knowledge sharing and reward systems. I
        still remember the moment I deployed my first ERC20 token to
        Ethereum—watching the transaction confirm and seeing the token appear in
        a test wallet was thrilling. As lead full-stack developer, I built both
        the token system and a knowledge graph visualization that made expertise
        networks visible to users. The technical challenges of wallet
        integration and token distribution taught me fundamental Web3 concepts,
        but more importantly, this project showed me how blockchain could create
        entirely new models for valuing human contributions.

        , a community-driven Block Producer rating tool that became widely
        adopted in the EOS ecosystem. Alongside product work, I led local
        outreach efforts through workshops, meetups, and advocacy. Between 2019
        and 2020, I also worked on two Web3 consumer apps: at Emanate, I
        maintained the streaming platform and managed artist revenue
        distribution; at Sense Chat, I helped build a secure messaging app with
        integrated wallet and token incentives for community engagement.

        DeFi: Bitcash Bank & ChainGraph
      </h2>
      <p className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert">
        In late 2020, I joined Bitcash Bank, a crypto-native banking experiment
        aimed at expanding financial access. I worked across the stack—building
        token dashboards, backend services, and a UI for managing balances and
        transactions. The product centered around a consumer-grade wallet with
        WebAuthN-based key management and smooth onboarding, designed for
        mainstream usability. I contributed to the development of a P2P system
        and overcollateralized crypto stablecoins for each country.
      </p>

      <p className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert mt-4">
        During this time, I also built ChainGraph, a high-performance blockchain
        indexer for EOS. It enabled fast, reliable transaction data queries, and
        strengthened my expertise in blockchain data structures, indexing, and
        real-time data pipelines. This project addressed a common frustration I
        had experienced repeatedly—the difficulty of accessing and working with
        on-chain data in real-time.
      </p>

      <p className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert mt-4">
        The moment when I first queried complex blockchain data with a simple
        GraphQL request and watched real-time updates stream into a test
        application felt like breaking through a barrier. Beyond the technical
        achievements, this project reinforced my belief that reducing friction
        for developers is essential for broader blockchain adoption. Creating
        tools that make complex technology more accessible continues to be a
        driving motivation in my work.

        I led development of the frontend and wallet flows, integrating bidding
