        Professional Journey
      </h1>

      <p className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert">
        I began my tech journey at CenfoTec University in San Jos√© in 2006,
        where I discovered a passion for software product development. By 2008,
        I was crafting custom WordPress solutions for businesses at
        InterGraphicDESIGNS. In 2009, I stepped into a UI Engineer role at{' '}
        <Link href="/project/american-express" className="prose-link">
          American Express

        , where I helped modernize their web platform and implement responsive
        layouts.

        In 2010, I founded{' '}
        <Link href="/project/costa-rica-js" className="prose-link">

        , which grew to become Central America's largest JavaScript community,
        with over 2,000 developers. It was incredible to see how this community
        helped foster the region's tech ecosystem as Node.js and modern web
        frameworks gained prominence.
