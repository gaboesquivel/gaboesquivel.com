        Backend Development Experience
      </h1>

      <p className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert">
        My journey into backend development began with a fascination for how
        systems communicate behind the scenes. While many developers were
        focused on creating visually appealing interfaces, I found myself drawn
        to the architecture that powers these experiences. I still remember the
        first time I built a real-time data pipeline that seamlessly connected
        disparate systems—watching data flow through the infrastructure I'd
        created felt like solving an intricate puzzle. Throughout my career,
        I've approached backend engineering with a focus on building reliable
        foundations that enable innovation at the application layer, believing
        that thoughtful system design creates both technical stability and
        business agility.

        Early Node.js & Community Building
      </h2>
      <p className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert">
        I adopted Node.js in Latin America around 2010-2011, when server-side
        JavaScript was just emerging as a viable backend technology. What
        excited me about Node wasn't just the technical aspects, but its
        potential to unify frontend and backend development under a single
        language. To build a regional community around this technology, I
        founded{' '}

        and regular meetups, I helped local developers bridge the gap between
        client and server development, creating a thriving ecosystem that
        continues today.

          4Tius Fitness Data Tracker
        </Link>
        , implementing a fitness analytics platform with AWS, MongoDB, and
        Node.js. This project presented unique challenges in data
        synchronization and real-time processing—I remember the satisfaction of
        seeing activity data stream from wearable devices into our system and
        transform into actionable insights almost instantly. The system
        processed wearable device data and served analytics via RESTful APIs,
        leveraging Node's event-driven architecture for real-time data handling
        in ways that would have been much more complex with traditional backend
        technologies.

        , Costa Rica's first neo-bank, where I faced the significant challenge
        of developing backend services that had to integrate with traditional
        banking systems while delivering a modern digital experience. The
        technical complexity was matched only by the regulatory requirements—I
        recall spending weeks ensuring our transaction processing met both
        security standards and compliance rules while still providing a seamless
        user experience. I implemented secure biometric authentication and
        transaction processing systems, laying the foundation for my later work
        in financial applications. This experience taught me the importance of
        building resilient systems that could handle sensitive financial data
        with both security and performance in mind—a balance that would become
        increasingly important in my later work with blockchain technologies.

        mechanisms that became widely adopted in the EOS ecosystem. The
        challenge of creating a system that was both transparent enough for

        , a specialized real-time GraphQL toolkit for blockchain applications.
        This project emerged from my frustration with existing tools for
        blockchain data access—I wanted to create something that made complex
        on-chain data accessible through modern API patterns. The moment when I
        first queried complex blockchain data with a simple GraphQL request and
        watched real-time updates stream into a test application felt like
        breaking through a barrier that had been limiting developer
        productivity. ChainGraph featured sophisticated blockchain data indexing
        and event streaming capabilities, showcasing how proper data modeling
        could transform complex blockchain interactions into developer-friendly
        experiences. Beyond the technical achievements, this project reinforced
        my belief that reducing friction for developers is essential for broader
        blockchain adoption.
