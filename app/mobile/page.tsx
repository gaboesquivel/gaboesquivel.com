        I've developed multiple mobile applications using React Native and Expo,
        creating cross-platform experiences that combine native performance with
        the flexibility of React development. My mobile projects range from
        secure messaging apps to AI-powered legal assistants, each leveraging
        modern mobile development practices and frameworks.

        (2015), Costa Rica's first neo-bank, where I led the development of
        their mobile banking platform. Using React Native, I implemented secure
        biometric authentication and API integrations with partner banks. This
        early experience established my approach to creating intuitive,
        high-performance mobile experiences with security as a priority.

        (2024-2025), I integrated a sophisticated AI assistant with both voice
        and chat capabilities into their React Native (Expo) mobile app. The
        assistant empowers lawyers to swiftly access case information, providing
        contextual legal support, document summaries, and procedural guidance.
        Using the Vercel AI SDK for chat and OpenAI's Realtime API for voice
        features, I developed a seamless multimodal interface styled with
        Tailwind CSS, supporting both Spanish and English.

        (2019-2020), I enhanced their React Native app's performance and
        integrated it with the EOS mainnet for token functionality. The app
        focused on user data privacy and featured a built-in wallet with token
        incentives for communities. I optimized React Native components for
        better performance and reduced load times, while implementing secure
        blockchain-based transactions and enhanced security features for better
        user protection.

        (2015), Costa Rica's first neo-bank, I developed the first version of
        their mobile app and backend services within AWS. The app eliminated the
        need for physical branch visits, providing a complete online banking
        experience. My responsibilities included API integration with partner
        banks, implementing biometric authentication for enhanced security, and
        forming a dedicated development team focused on innovation and
        user-centric design. This project was a pioneering effort in the
        region's fintech space, bringing modern banking to mobile users.

        Hackathon. The app leverages the popularity of NBA Top Shot NFTs to
        create an engaging gaming experience, allowing users to utilize their
        NFTs in a fantasy sports setting. I implemented responsive UI and smooth
        gameplay mechanics using React Native and Expo, while integrating Flow
        blockchain technology for secure NFT transactions.

        (2021), I enhanced their mobile app by developing an augmented reality
        feature for product previews. This integration allowed customers to
        visualize products in their own space before purchasing. I also improved
        the app's performance and code quality, implementing TypeScript for
        better maintainability and scalability.

        (2022), I built a progressive web app that connects to OpenAI's LLM
        models to generate AI images and mint them on the Flow blockchain. This
        app integrates AI with blockchain technology, enabling users to create
        and own unique digital art pieces. The project showcases how mobile
        interfaces can bridge creative expression with on-chain ownership.
