        technologies, I found myself drawn to the connections between them—the
        architecture that makes complete products possible. I still remember the
        first time I built an application end-to-end, watching data flow from
        database to interface without friction—it felt like completing a complex
        puzzle where every piece had to fit perfectly. Throughout my career,
        I've approached fullstack development as an integrated discipline where
        architecture decisions flow from user needs, rather than treating UI and
        infrastructure as separate concerns. This holistic perspective reflects
        my belief that technology should deliver cohesive solutions to real
        human problems, not just isolated technical achievements.
