**Other Important Links:**
- Project pages (/project/*): 11 links across 9 articles
- Technology pages (/tech/*): 71 links across 30 articles

## Detailed Analysis

### Domain Specialization Links (Highest Priority)

1. **Well-Linked Domain Pages**
   - `/web3`: Strong coverage with 31 links across 21 articles (mostly recent)
   - `/ai`: Good coverage with 21 links across 11 articles (mostly recent)
   - `/lead`: Decent coverage with 12 links across 11 articles

2. **Moderately Linked Domain Pages**
   - `/frontend`: Moderate coverage with 11 links across 10 articles
   - `/backend`: Limited coverage with 7 links across 6 articles

3. **Poorly Linked Domain Pages**
   - `/mobile`: Very limited coverage with 5 links across only 2 articles
   - `/fullstack`: Minimal coverage with 3 links across 3 articles
   - `/startups`: Minimal coverage with 3 links across 3 articles
   - `/institutions`: Minimal coverage with 3 links across 3 articles

4. **Completely Unlinked Domain Pages**
   - `/bio`: No links found

### Professional Pages (Secondary Priority)

All professional pages are currently unlinked from blog content:
- `/cv`: No links found
- `/connect`: No links found

### Portfolio Pages (Lower Priority)

Portfolio pages have mixed linking status:
- `/project/*`: Limited coverage with 11 links across 9 articles
- `/work`: No links found
- `/tech/*`: Excellent coverage with 71 links across 30 articles

## Key Observations

1. **Domain Concept Linking Gaps**
   - Several key domain pages (`/bio`) have no links at all
   - Many domain pages (`/fullstack`, `/startups`, `/institutions`) have minimal linking
   - Even for well-linked domains, the coverage is inconsistent across articles

2. **Chronological Patterns**
   - Recent articles (2023-2025) tend to have better linking practices
   - Older articles (pre-2023) generally have fewer strategic links
   - Technology links are more prevalent than domain concept links overall

3. **Over-Reliance on Technology Links**
   - Technology links (71) significantly outnumber domain links for most categories
   - This contradicts the priority order (Domain > Project > Technology) in the linking strategy

4. **Project Link Underutilization**
   - Only 11 project links found across all articles
   - Many articles that mention specific projects don't link to them

## Recommendations

### Immediate Action Items

1. **Add Links to Completely Unlinked Pages**
   - Prioritize adding links to `/bio` pages
   - Identify relevant articles where these domains are discussed but not linked

2. **Improve Coverage of Poorly Linked Pages**
   - Focus on increasing links to `/fullstack`, `/startups`, and `/institutions`
   - Review articles that discuss these domains but don't link to them

3. **Balance Technology and Domain Links**
   - In articles with multiple technology links, evaluate adding domain concept links
   - Ensure domain concepts take priority over technology mentions

### Long-Term Strategy

1. **Implement Systematic Link Auditing**
   - Regularly review new and updated content for linking opportunities
   - Create a checklist for content writers to follow the linking hierarchy

2. **Prioritize by Content Relevance**
   - Focus first on articles with the strongest topical relevance to each landing page
   - Then expand to articles with secondary relevance

3. **Develop a Linking Calendar**
   - Create a schedule for updating older content
   - Prioritize high-traffic or SEO-valuable content first

## Conclusion

While some landing pages (/web3, /ai, /lead) have reasonable coverage, there are significant gaps in the current linking implementation. Several important landing pages have minimal or no links from blog content, reducing their visibility and SEO value. 

The predominance of technology links over domain and project links suggests that the current implementation doesn't fully align with the linking hierarchy defined in the strategy. A focused effort to implement the recommended link improvements would significantly enhance the site's internal link structure and align it better with the defined strategy.
