## SEO Strategy

1. **Structure:**  
   - Each landing page mirrors `/web3` and `/ai`: intro (vision + philosophy), timeline/project highlights, closing insight.  
   - Consistent URL structure: `/frontend`, `/backend`, `/fullstack`, `/react-native`.  

2. **Keywords:**  
   - **Frontend:** React developer, Next.js engineer, UI/UX, TypeScript, Tailwind, dApp interfaces  
   - **Backend:** Node.js engineer, Supabase, PostgreSQL, GraphQL APIs, blockchain indexers, **AWS, Terraform, Google Cloud, infrastructure engineer**  
   - **Fullstack:** Full-stack engineer, product engineering, end-to-end development, Web3 + AI integration, **cloud architecture, DevOps, Docker, GCP, AWS**  
   - **React Native:** React Native developer, mobile apps, cross-platform wallets, AI assistants, Expo apps  

3. **Internal linking:**  
   - Cross-link between **all landing pages** (frontend ↔ backend ↔ fullstack ↔ react-native).  
   - Link to project pages (`/projects/...`) for SEO depth and engagement.  
   - Link back to `/bio` and `/cv` for authority and career context.  

4. **Content strategy:**  
   - Emphasize practical achievements with real projects.  
   - Avoid generic claims; ground each page in portfolio examples.  
   - Use structured headings, bullet highlights, and concise sections for readability.  

5. **Meta + Open Graph:**  
   - Custom meta titles + descriptions per page.  
   - Use featured project images as OG images for richer previews.
