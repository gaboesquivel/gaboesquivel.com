- `/project` → Detailed project pages with specific implementations
- `/tech` → Technology expertise and stack proficiency

## Content Integration Strategy

### Blog Post Link Integration
Our refined content strategy focuses on strategically integrating high-value links within blog content while maintaining readability and user experience:

1. **Strategic Link Categories & Hierarchy:**
   - **Domain Specializations (Highest Priority):** Link broad domain words to specialization pages
     - DeFi and web3  → `/web3` 
     - AI  → `/ai`
     - Frontend  → `/frontend`
     - Backend, DB and cloud  → `/backend`
     - Mobile, React Native  → `/mobile`
     - Technical leadership → `/lead`
     - Startup development → `/startups`
     - Enterprise/institutional work → `/institutions`
   
   - **Project Implementations (Medium Priority):** Link specific project mentions to project pages
     - "BitLauncher" → `/project/bitlauncher`
     - "Opyn protocol" → `/project/opyn`
     - "Masterbots" → `/project/masterbots`
     
   - **Technology Mentions (Lower Priority):** Link specific technology mentions to tech pages
     - "Next.js" → `/tech/next-js` (not just to generic `/tech`)
     - "Supabase" → `/tech/supabase`
     - "GraphQL" → `/tech/graphql`
   
   - **Chronological Integrity:** Always respect publication dates—never link to projects in posts dated before the project existed

2. **Precise Linking Rules:**
   - **Domain Concepts Over Technologies:** When a concept belongs to a domain specialization, link to that specialization page rather than a technology page
     - "DeFi primitives" → `/web3` (not to `/project/opyn` or `/tech`)
     - "Blockchain indexing" → `/web3` (not to `/tech/blockchain`)
     - "AI assistants" → `/ai` (not to `/tech/llm`)
     - "Startup MVP" → `/startups` (not to specific startup projects)
     - "Enterprise compliance" → `/institutions` (not to specific institution projects)
   
   - **Specific Tech Links:** When mentioning specific technologies, link to their dedicated tech landing pages
     - "Next.js App Router" → `/tech/next-js` (specific tech page, not generic `/tech`)
     - "PostgreSQL" → `/tech/postgresql`
     - "React" → `/tech/react`
   
   - **Project Name Recognition:** Only link explicit project name mentions to project pages
     - Link "BitLauncher analytics dashboard" → `/project/bitlauncher`
     - Don't link "our analytics dashboard" to a project page unless project is explicitly named

3. **Balanced Linking Implementation:**
   - **Quality over Quantity:** Each link must provide genuine value to the reader
   - **Non-Repetition:** Use only one link per target page within a single blog post
   - **Natural Context:** Links must feel organic within the content's flow
   - **Diverse Anchors:** Use descriptive and varied anchor text that accurately describes the linked content
   - **Limit Per Post:** Maximum 3-5 total links per blog post (across all categories)
   - **Hierarchy Distribution:** Prioritize domain specialization links (1-2), then add project links (0-1) and tech links (0-2) as relevant
   - **Priority Order:** Domain Specialization > Project > Technology

4. **Example Implementations:**

```markdown
// Original blog text:
Building efficient React applications requires careful state management in modern DeFi interfaces.

// Enhanced with precise linking strategy:
Building efficient [React](/tech/react) applications requires careful state management in modern [DeFi interfaces](/web3).

   - **Domain Specialization Priority:** Prioritize inbound links to domain specialization pages (/web3, /ai, /frontend, etc.) as they have long-term value
   - **Technology Page Targeting:** For technology-specific mentions in external content, target specific tech pages (/tech/next-js, /tech/supabase)
   - **Hierarchical Referral Mapping:**
     - When mentioned in broad domain contexts → Link to specialization pages
     - When mentioned with specific projects → Link to project pages
     - When mentioned with specific technologies → Link to tech pages
   - **Guest Posting Strategy:** When writing external content, link back following the same hierarchy:
     - For domain concepts: Link to specialization pages first
     - For specific project mentions: Link to project pages
     - For specific tech discussions: Link to tech pages
   - **Content Development:** Create shareable expert content aligned with each specialization domain to attract high-quality backlinks
