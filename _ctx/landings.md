- `/project` → Detailed project pages with specific implementations
- `/tech` → Technology expertise and stack proficiency

## Content Integration Strategy

### Blog Post Link Integration
Our refined content strategy focuses on strategically integrating high-value links within blog content while maintaining readability and user experience:

1. **Strategic Link Categories:**
   - **Experience/Main Landings:** Link to relevant expertise pages (`/frontend`, `/backend`, etc.) when discussing related concepts
   - **Project Pages:** Link to specific project implementations that demonstrate concepts discussed
   - **Tech Pages:** Link to technology expertise pages when discussing specific technologies

2. **Balanced Linking Principles:**
   - **Quality over Quantity:** Each link must provide genuine value to the reader
   - **Non-Repetition:** Use only one link per target page within a single blog post
   - **Natural Context:** Links must feel organic within the content's flow
   - **Diverse Anchors:** Use descriptive and varied anchor text that accurately describes the linked content

3. **Implementation Guidelines:**
   - Links should enhance reader understanding, not distract from content
   - Limit to 3-5 total links per blog post (across all categories)
   - Prioritize linking to content that extends or deepens the blog topic
   - Balance link distribution across different page categories

4. **Example Implementations:**

```markdown
// Original blog text:
Building efficient React applications requires careful state management.

// Enhanced with experience landing page link:
Building efficient [React applications](/frontend) requires careful state management.
```

```markdown
// Original blog text:
Our BitLauncher project implemented a custom EVM indexer.

// Enhanced with project page link:
Our [BitLauncher project](/projects/bitlauncher) implemented a custom EVM indexer.
```

```markdown
// Original blog text:
We used Next.js App Router for server-side rendering.

// Enhanced with tech page link:
We used [Next.js App Router](/tech/nextjs) for server-side rendering.
```

5. **Priority Content:**
   - Focus first on high-traffic blog posts
   - Prioritize recent content (2023-2025)
   - Target posts with strong SEO potential based on search trends and keyword research
