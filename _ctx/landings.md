### 1. Experience & Main Landing Pages
These pages showcase professional expertise in specific domains:
- `/frontend` → Frontend Engineering Experience
- `/backend` → Backend & Infrastructure Engineering Experience  
- `/fullstack` → Full-Stack Product & Cloud Engineering
- `/web3` → Web3 Development Experience
- `/ai` → AI Engineering Experience
- `/react-native` → React Native & Mobile Development
- `/lead` → Tech Leadership Experience
- `/bio` → Comprehensive Biography

### 2. Professional Pages
These pages provide structured professional information:

- `/connect` → Professional contact information

### 3. Portfolio & Showcase Pages
These pages highlight work and technical expertise:
- `/work` → Work portfolio overview and case studies
- `/project` → Detailed project pages with specific implementations
- `/tech` → Technology expertise and stack proficiency

## Content Integration Strategy

### Blog Post Link Integration
Our refined content strategy focuses on strategically integrating high-value links within blog content while maintaining readability and user experience:

1. **Strategic Link Categories & Hierarchy:**
   - **Domain Specializations (Highest Priority):** Link broad domain concepts to specialization pages
     - DeFi concepts → `/web3` (not to specific projects or tech)
     - AI concepts → `/ai`
     - Frontend patterns → `/frontend`
     - Backend architecture → `/backend`
     - Mobile development → `/react-native`
     - Technical leadership → `/lead`
   
   - **Project Implementations (Medium Priority):** Link specific project mentions to project pages
     - "BitLauncher" → `/project/bitlauncher`
     - "Opyn protocol" → `/project/opyn`
     - "Masterbots" → `/project/masterbots`
     
   - **Technology Mentions (Lower Priority):** Link specific technology mentions to tech pages
     - "Next.js" → `/tech/next-js` (not just to generic `/tech`)
     - "Supabase" → `/tech/supabase`
     - "GraphQL" → `/tech/graphql`
   
   - **Chronological Integrity:** Always respect publication dates—never link to projects in posts dated before the project existed

2. **Precise Linking Rules:**
   - **Domain Concepts Over Technologies:** When a concept belongs to a domain specialization, link to that specialization page rather than a technology page
     - "DeFi primitives" → `/web3` (not to `/project/opyn` or `/tech`)
     - "Blockchain indexing" → `/web3` (not to `/tech/blockchain`)
     - "AI assistants" → `/ai` (not to `/tech/llm`)
   
   - **Specific Tech Links:** When mentioning specific technologies, link to their dedicated tech landing pages
     - "Next.js App Router" → `/tech/next-js` (specific tech page, not generic `/tech`)
     - "PostgreSQL" → `/tech/postgresql`
     - "React" → `/tech/react`
   
   - **Project Name Recognition:** Only link explicit project name mentions to project pages
     - Link "BitLauncher analytics dashboard" → `/project/bitlauncher`
     - Don't link "our analytics dashboard" to a project page unless project is explicitly named

3. **Balanced Linking Implementation:**
   - **Quality over Quantity:** Each link must provide genuine value to the reader
   - **Non-Repetition:** Use only one link per target page within a single blog post
   - **Natural Context:** Links must feel organic within the content's flow
   - **Diverse Anchors:** Use descriptive and varied anchor text that accurately describes the linked content
   - **Limit Per Post:** Maximum 3-5 total links per blog post (across all categories)
   - **Hierarchy Distribution:** Prioritize domain specialization links (1-2), then add project links (0-1) and tech links (0-2) as relevant
   - **Priority Order:** Domain Specialization > Project > Technology

4. **Example Implementations:**

```markdown
// Original blog text:
Building efficient React applications requires careful state management in modern DeFi interfaces.

// Enhanced with precise linking strategy:
Building efficient [React](/tech/react) applications requires careful state management in modern [DeFi interfaces](/web3).
```

```markdown
// Original blog text:
Our BitLauncher project implemented a custom EVM indexer using Node.js and PostgreSQL.

// Enhanced with precise linking strategy:
Our [BitLauncher project](/project/bitlauncher) implemented a custom EVM indexer using [Node.js](/tech/nodejs) and [PostgreSQL](/tech/postgresql).
```

```markdown
// Original blog text:
We used Next.js App Router for server-side rendering in our frontend applications.

// Enhanced with precise linking strategy:
We used [Next.js App Router](/tech/next-js) for server-side rendering in our [frontend applications](/frontend).
```

5. **Priority Content:**
   - Focus first on high-traffic blog posts
   - Prioritize recent content (2023-2025)
   - Target posts with strong SEO potential based on search trends and keyword research

     - Respect chronology (only link to projects that existed at publication time)
     - Max 0-1 project links per post
   
   - **Blog to Tech (Lower Priority):** Link specific tech mentions to dedicated tech pages
     - Link "Next.js" → `/tech/next-js` (not generic `/tech`)
     - Link "PostgreSQL" → `/tech/postgresql`
     - Max 0-2 technology links per post
   
   - **Landing Page Interlinking:**
     - **Specialization to Projects:** Link domain expertise to concrete project implementations
     - **Specialization to Specialization:** Connect related domains (e.g., `/web3` → `/fullstack`)
     - **Project to Tech:** Connect project implementations to specific technologies used

4. **Content Strategy by Category:**

   - **Domain Specialization Priority:** Prioritize inbound links to domain specialization pages (/web3, /ai, /frontend, etc.) as they have long-term value
   - **Technology Page Targeting:** For technology-specific mentions in external content, target specific tech pages (/tech/next-js, /tech/supabase)
   - **Hierarchical Referral Mapping:**
     - When mentioned in broad domain contexts → Link to specialization pages
     - When mentioned with specific projects → Link to project pages
     - When mentioned with specific technologies → Link to tech pages
   - **Guest Posting Strategy:** When writing external content, link back following the same hierarchy:
     - For domain concepts: Link to specialization pages first
     - For specific project mentions: Link to project pages
     - For specific tech discussions: Link to tech pages
   - **Content Development:** Create shareable expert content aligned with each specialization domain to attract high-quality backlinks
